0  Use of a shared patient care plan for improved inter-professional and patient communications and coordination of care .
0  Use of standardized evidence-based clinical content and clinical decision support for improved patient safety and care evaluation .
0  The primary purpose of the EHR is to provide a documented record of care that supports present and future care by the same or other clinicians. Any other purpose for which the health record is used may be considered secondary .
0  The ED is a unique care setting where a number of non-clinical associates as well as administrators and managers must have access to the system .
0  Furthermore  users may at different times have different roles .
0  The following table should be used as a guide to the nomenclature used to describe users who may interact with an EDIS .
0  For instance  functions pertaining to the functions related to prescribing are usually granted to physicians  physician assistants and nurse practitioners  so users of such functions would be described as a licensed prescriber but not as a user or a provider .
1  Tracking physical location can be accomplished by capturing updates to the patients location that are manually entered by users into the system  or it can be done in an automated fashion using radio-frequency ID (RFID) or other technologies .
1  The system should track patient physical location through all phases of visit  from pre-arrival through disposition .
1  At certain times the actual location of the patient may require supporting information .
0  For instance  a patient who has been sent to radiology may require his or her patient room to be saved because the patients family members or personal belongings remain .
0  Tracking the status of care is covered in Clinical Workflow Tracking and Task Management .
0  Tracking of patients progress through the ED encounter requires the capture of certain milestones in the business logic behind the system .
0  For instance  when a patient is moved from the waiting room to a patient room  the time the patient entered the treatment area should be automatically captured .
0  Patient arrival and registration are relatively complex and time-sensitive tasks involving data capture of both clinical and administrative data .
0  In most cases  the EDIS is not the primary system used to capture the gamut of demographic or administrative information .
0  Instead  a record is generated in the EDIS upon patient entry  and further demographic and administrative data are sent to the system via HL7 messaging once the patient is formally registered into the hospital ADT system .
0  Critical to this workflow is the ability to manage the patient before formal registration has occurred  the identification of a single patient ID and record in both the EDIS systems and hospital systems  timely generation of a hospital account or billing number to facilitate interoperability with other hospital systems .
0  The process of merging administrative data captured in the hospital system with the unique patient record in the EDIS should be largely automated  and only require human intervention if errors in either process prevent a certain match of the data .
0  Because the emergency department patient is ideally first encountered by a clinical provider (i .e . triage nurse) and not registration personnel  a search for past visits in the EDIS should be available to providers to retrieve medical summary data that has been captured in previous visits  including the patients problem list  medications or allergies .
0  Conversely  identification of a patients previous visits prior to triage or formal registration should not be required .
0  In fact  it should be possible to enter a patient into the EDIS without any demographic information (i .e . John or Jane Doe) .
0  Quick registration is another process that allows clinical providers to enter the minimal amount of data sufficient to generate a new encounter or account number for the patient .
0  This permits clinicians to order tests and other procedures on the patient although formal registration and verification of administrative data has not yet occurred .
0  Full registration is the process whereby administrative personnel capture the entire spectrum of demographic information including contacts  addresses  and insurance information .
0  In the ED  there exists a critical need for distributed communication of the status of workflow tasks .
0  An essential EDIS function is the management and display of tasks to be accomplished .
0  The management of tasks within the EDIS requires the maintenance of a master set of tasks  the ability to invoke those tasks  and a method for displaying those tasks .
0  Tasks include orders tasks  consultations tasks  clinical tasks such as transportation to radiology  and flags for patient follow-up  etc .
0  Tasks must be assigned to at least one entity  and in the ED are usually assigned to a member of the healthcare team or to a department (i .e . radiology) .
0  Tasks are also either linked to a particular patient  or occasionally to infrastructure in the ED (i .e . a bed that needs cleaning) .
0  For instance  in one ED  the assignment of an order for a Chest Radiograph may be assigned to the patients primary RN alone  who carries out the task of ordering the study in the hospital information system and contacting transport to take the patient to the radiology department (sub-optimal) .
0  The system must link every clinical task to a particular patient and resource .
0  Resources may include members of the health care team  objects such as stock items  and on occasion a place in the ED chart .
0  For instance  an order for an ECG could be linked to the patients primary ED nurse  to the hospital heart station  to the ECG section of the chart to prompt the ED physician for an interpretation  and to the charge capture system .
0  The system must also display those tasks which have been ordered or initiated  but have not been completed  as well as display and notify providers about tasks which have returned results that are awaiting review .
0  The tracking and display of tasks takes two major forms\: the display of the status of tasks for an individual patient  and .
0  The tracking and display of tasks takes two major forms\: the display of tasks for a particular member of the healthcare team (i .e . MD  RN or Tech) or external department (i .e . Radiology  Laboratory  and Admitting) .
0  The system must provide means to order laboratory tasks  radiology tasks  medications tasks  nursing tasks  and materials management .
0  Orders are a unique subset of clinical tasks that possess certain qualities .
0  As with all tasks  an individual order may actually comprise a number of bundled tasks .
0  For instance  an order for a complete blood count may comprise a number of sub-tasks  including obtaining the blood specimen  transporting the specimen to the lab  initiating the order in the laboratory system  and creating tasks to the physician to complete including review and documentation of results .
0  For success  orders must be highly specific and customizable by personnel role  physical location  and patient-specific factors (i .e . major trauma patient) .
0  For instance  the order for an ECG may be carried out by an ED RN in one institution  and a person from heart station in another .
0  Roles such as these may be shared or vary by time of day or day of week .
0  The system must support the capture of clinical documentation by all ED providers including physicians  nurses  technologists  transporters  and any other providers of clinical care .
0  The system should permit providers to document both observations and medical decision making and to reflect exactly what each provider wants to say .
0  For example  a patients list of medications may be incorporated from a previous encounter  verified and updated in triage .
0  This process is frequently duplicated by the physician or other provider as part of their history and documentation .
0  This information re-use requires the ability to manage inter-practitioner discrepancies  allowing providers to agree information  comment information  update information  or annotate information gleaned at different points during the encounter .
0  Sometimes this means commenting on findings that are not duplicated  sometimes it means verification of findings  but in all cases it means not having discrepancies which can be of severe medical and medical-legal consequence .
0  Proper documentation of an encounter such as this would require proper time stamps for when data was available and documented .
0  ED clinicians frequently must wait until the end or stay after an assigned shift  to find time to complete records .
0  Moreover  ED records are often created discontinuously  and systems need to consider provisions for permitting staggered  delayed  and offsite completion of records as well as monitoring and reporting their completion .
0  The system should provide a means for a provider to display patient records needing attention or completion .
0  The system should provide a means to create addendums to documents that have already been signed and hence cannot be changed .
0  The system must also allow for completion of the encounter record in a discontinuous sequence  but to retain particular formatting .
0  For instance  a physician may write discharge instructions and prescriptions to discharge a patient quickly  but not document the history and physical until much later .
0  ED Physicians sometime do not get documentation completed at the end of each shift .
0  It is conceivable in a busy shift that a physician may want to look over his or her clinical documentation before signing the chart .
0  Documentation should be able to be done in any order  with good perspectives of what has and has not been completed  as well as what remains to be completed .
0  The system needs to provide a means to track all flavors of outstanding patient issues after the ED visit is completed .
0  For example  the system should allow providers to identify patients with outstanding laboratory study issues  radiological study issues  or other diagnostic study issues  or to arrange follow-up care that could not be adjudicated prior to discharge .
1  These tasks may be delegated to a particular person or may be displayed to entire ED staff .
0  In addition  the system needs to track patients requiring administrative action after discharge (i .e . patient satisfaction or other non-clinical follow-up) .
0  Furthermore  the system need to provide a means to reconcile preliminary diagnostic test results with the final interpretations of the services requested (i .e . reconcile ED interpretation with ultimate radiologist dictation) .
0  Hence  interoperability with radiology information system and ECG system (not traditional interfaces) becomes desirable (see interoperability) .

0  The following are the principal types of PHI discussed in this document\: audit logs of who has accessed or updated any of the data listed in items a to g above  including identifiers assigned to accessing users  the logged actions they have performed (adding data  updating data  overriding consent directives if applicable during medical emergencies  etc .)  and the logged values of fields that have been added  updated  or annotated .
0  Organisations connecting to the EHRi and organisations hosting components of the EHRi must implement policies and practices  including\: Training users and communicating to users information about the organisations privacy policies and practices (see Privacy Requirement 22b and Security Requirement 15); and operational not in .
0  The confidentiality of data related to healthcare providers also needs to be considered .
0  In order to allow patients or persons to make appropriate decisions about their PHI  it is important that they are made aware of and understand the purposes for which it is being collected  used  and disclosed .
0  Make a reasonable effort to inform patient or persons of these purposes  in a readily understandable manner  prior to collecting their PHI .
0  The goal is to make a reasonable effort to ensure that patients or persons understand the purposes for which organisations connected to the EHRi and organisations hosting components of the EHRi collect  use and disclose their PHI .24 .
0  Depending upon the way in which PHI is collected  organisations can fulfill this requirement orally  in writing  or by posting a notice .
0  An admission or appointment form  for example  may give notice of the purposes .
0  However  the novelty of the EHR and the anxiety it can arouse about the protection of privacy interests make it imperative that patients or persons be informed  in an appropriate way  of the prospective uses and disclosures of their personal information .
0  Organisations connecting to the EHRi or organisations hosting components of the EHRi should only collect PHI necessary to fulfill the purposes that they have identified (see Privacy Requirement 5) .
0  Such patients or persons have a right to know what uses and disclosures  in particular  are mandated by law  such as for mandatory reporting of infectious diseases or suspected child abuse or for law enforcement .
1  Laws may require express  implied or deemed consent for specific collections  uses and disclosures of PHI .
1  Express consent includes any action by a patient or person or their authorized representative (e .g . parent  guardian or substitute decision maker) specifically to authorize the collection  use or disclosure of personal information (e .g . a signature  a check-off box  a verbal approval) .
1  The assumption of reasonableness usually rests on how well the patient or person was informed about the intended collection  use  or disclosure of his or her personal information .
1  An organisation should be able to demonstrate that it complied with applicable legislative requirements and that the patient or person had a reasonable opportunity to know that information was going to be collected and used for specific purposes and persisted with the action that resulted in the information flow .26  27 .
1  It is assumed that based on jurisdictional requirements for consent that at least some POS systems connected to the EHRi may eventually have specific consent fields that will allow POS users to enter how consent was obtained or check-off how consent was obtained  withdrawn or revoked in those cases where consent was required for specific activities .
1  An interoperable EHR may therefore require the capturing of consent for the collection  use and disclosure of PHI in many ways .
1  For example\: An admission form or appointment form may be used to seek consent  collect PHI  and inform patients or persons of the uses that will be made of their PHI .
1  For example\: A check-off box may be used to allow patients or persons to request that their PHI not be shared with other organisations  the so-called lock box concept .28 Patients or persons who do not check off the box are assumed to consent to the transfer of this information to third parties .
1  For example\: Consent may be given orally; or .
1  For example\: Consent may also be given at the time that patients or persons use a health service .
1  The EHRi must reflect legal obligations in its privacy requirements in all of their relative sophistication in this novel area .
1  The ultimate obligation is to meet the wishes of the patient or person  in those circumstances where he or she is able to place express instructions on the allowable uses and disclosures of his or her PHI .29 .
0  Except where inappropriate (e .g . specifically exempted by law or professional code of practice)  organisations connecting to the EHRi  and organisations hosting components of the EHRi should obtain the knowledge31 and consent of each patient or person for the collection  use or disclosure of his or her PHI and where required by law  must obtain the knowledge and consent of each patient or person for the collection  use or disclosure of his or her PHI .32 .
0  In addition to meeting these legal requirements  healthcare organisations should also seek to meet high ethical and moral standards for information consent  which is vital to the protection of privacy as an aspect of human dignity and the protection of human rights .
0  Several regulatory colleges have advised their members to seek consent for the collection  use or disclosure of PHI .
1  The requirement to acquire patients or persons knowledge and consent gives them an element of control over their PHI  but allows for this control to be overridden in specific circumstances for reasons of public or individual safety or ensuring the efficient operation of the healthcare system .
1  It is important to note that a patient or person may withdraw consent at any time  subject to legal or contractual restrictions .
1  In the healthcare setting  the withdrawal of consent may in fact make it impossible for a patient or person to receive  or continue to receive  healthcare .
1  POS systems connected to the EHRi where required by law  must be able to record a patient or persons consent directives  including the withholding  withdrawal or revocation of consent .
1  Rationale\: Healthcare organisations must know that they have obtained the consents required in their particular jurisdiction for the purposes for which they will collect  use PHI or disclose PHI (see Privacy Requirement 5) .
1  The form of the consent sought by organisations connecting to the EHRi may vary  depending upon the jurisdiction  circumstances under which the information was collected (e .g . medical emergencies) and the type of information (e .g . mandatory reporting of communicable diseases) .
1  In the Canadian EHR environment  the required forms of consent are largely established by various laws  most notably health data protection legislation and public sector privacy legislation .
1  Those entering PHI into a POS system within a particular jurisdiction have the primary obligation of obtaining and recording the consent directives of patients or persons .
1  The POS system has to ensure that those accessing this PHI only obtain access to information that is legitimately available on the basis of consent or legal authorization to use or disclose (e .g .  auditing or law enforcement) .
1  Where POS systems connected to the EHRi record a patient or persons consent directives  including the withholding  withdrawal or revocation of consent  such POS systems must transmit these consent directives to the EHRi  in a consistent form  whenever they transmit the associated PHI to the EHRi .
0  Where these directives are collected  it is essential that they be transmitted to the EHRi whenever the associated PHI is to be transmitted .
0  This will ensure proper EHRi processing of these consent directives prior to transmission of PHI to another jurisdiction .
1  The EHRi where required by law  must be able to record a patient or persons consent directives  including the withholding  withdrawal or revocation of consent36 and must be able to do so in a way that allows each jurisdiction to comply with its own legal requirements on consent .
1  Rationale\: Healthcare organisations must be able to determine if a patient or person has provided or withheld consent as required in their particular jurisdiction .
1  Consequently  those organisations wishing to disclose PHI to another jurisdiction must do so in a manner that respects the legal requirements for consent in their own jurisdiction (i .e . the jurisdiction of the disclosing organisation) .
1  As a practical matter  a healthcare organisation wishing to access PHI from another jurisdiction must do so in a manner that respects the legal requirements for consent to disclose PHI in the jurisdiction of the organisation that holds the data as well as satisfy all the legal requirements for consent to access PHI in its own jurisdiction .
0  (Otherwise the sender cannot honour the access request) .
1  Information contained within a patient EHR or persons EHR may carry with it the legal requirements for consent from multiple jurisdictions (see Privacy Requirement 12) .
0  Before permitting accesses to PHI  the EHRi must ensure that all necessary legal requirements are upheld before transmitting data to a requestor .
1  When consent is required by law  whenever receiving  storing  processing  or transmitting PHI  the EHRi must be able to\: maintain the association between this data and the consent directives under Requirement Requirement which it may be used or disclosed .
1  When consent is required by law  whenever receiving  storing  processing  or transmitting PHI  the EHRi must be able to\: process these consent directives before transmitting the associated data and block the transmission where it would violate the directives and where no exception for such a disclosure is outlined in law; and .
1  When consent is required by law  whenever receiving  storing  processing  or transmitting PHI  the EHRi must be able to\: notify the requestor whenever data is blocked as in b) above .
1  Rationale\: This will allow organisations connecting to the EHRi  or hosting components of the EHRi  to apply a patient consent directives or persons consent directives in their jurisdiction as well as across jurisdictions .
1  EHRi and systems connecting to the EHRi will also need a consistent representation of consent directives and masking directives or lockbox directives in support of interoperability requirements between jurisdictions .
1  The EHRi must be able to\: log when the processing of consent directives (cf . Privacy Requirement 12  item b) prohibits the transmission of data; Tech Requirement .
0  The EHRi must be able to\: log the identity of any user who overrides a patient or persons consent directives  the reason for the consent override  and the date and time when the consent override occurred .
0  The EHRi must be able to\: alert the individual accountable for facilitating privacy compliance in the organisation where the accessing user works as well as in the organisation where the information was collected that such a consent override has occurred .
1  Furthermore  some health data protection legislation requires that health information custodians notify a patient or person if his or her information is stolen  lost  or accessed by unauthorized persons .38 The individual(s) responsible for facilitating an organisations privacy compliance will be greatly assisted in determining when a potential unauthorized access or disclosure of PHI has taken place if they are notified when an individuals consent directives are overridden .
1  Overriding of a patient consent directives or persons consent directives must be monitored in both the organisation where the PHI has been collected and the organisation from which the information is being accessed .39 .
0  As logs will themselves contain confidential information  they must be made both secure and tamper-proof .
1  In addition to logging overrides of a patient consent directives or persons consent directives (Item b in the list above) and alerting accountable individuals that a consent override has occurred (item c in the list above)  there is also a related requirement to notify patients or to notify persons when access has been deemed inappropriate (see Privacy Requirement 20) .
1  Organisations connecting to the EHRi or hosting components of the EHRi should ensure patients or persons are informed about the potential implications of their consent directives  including directives for locking or masking PHI .
1  Healthcare providers require all relevant PHI from a patient or persons medical history in order to definitively diagnose and safely treat a patient or person .
1  Therefore  when patients or persons request that their healthcare provider mask or lock components of their PHI  it may not be possible for their healthcare team to provide appropriate care .
1  The potential negative outcomes associated with locking or masking PHI relevant to a patient or persons care include misdiagnosis  adverse drug events or even healthcare providers refusing to provide care .40 These implications should be explained by qualified healthcare professionals to patients or persons in order to ensure that their full knowledge and consent is obtained (see Privacy Requirement 8) .
1  Where required to do so by law  the EHRi systems and POS systems connected to the EHRi must have the ability to indicate when consent is given on behalf of a patient or on behalf of a person by a substitute decision maker (e .g . consent given by an authorized representative)  as well as identify this substitute decision maker and the substitute decision makers relation to the patient or relation to the person .
1  Rationale\: Consent can be given not only by a patient or person but also be given by an authorized representative (such as a legal guardian  a substitute decision maker  or a person having power of attorney) .
1  The determination of an individuals substitute decision maker is typically a ranking process whereby if no individual fitting the first role or relationship in the list (e .g . spouse or guardian) can be found  then the custodian must attempt to locate the next potential substitute decision maker in the ranking process (e .g . sibling) .
1  When a suitable substitute decision make has been found  the custodian must document the relation of that substitute decision maker to the patient or person to ensure that the custodians selection can later be audited  justified  or reappraised .
1  Organisations connecting to the EHRi and organisations hosting components of the EHRi must not  as a condition of the supply of a service  require a patient or person to consent to the collection  use or disclosure of PHI beyond that required to fulfill the explicitly specified and legitimate purposes .
1  As such  rules for collection  use and disclosure should be strictly delineated and observed because patients will often not object to certain PHI collections  uses and disclosures in light of vulnerable health circumstances .
1  In the rare circumstances where a patient withdraws or withholds consent and the healthcare provider believes that care cannot be provided safely  the healthcare provider may determine that it is appropriate to refuse to provide treatment .42 .
1  As outlined in Privacy Requirement 5  organisations connecting to the EHRi and organisations hosting components of the EHRi should limit collection of PHI to that which is necessary for the identified purposes .
1  PHI should not be collected indiscriminately .
1  In an EHR environment  the use of electronic forms to gather personal information should facilitate a process of only collecting necessary information and  for example  clearly indicating when the provision of personal information is optional .
1  A caveat is that healthcare providers may collect any information deemed relevant to the purposes stated to patients or persons and then ensure that it is only used and disclosed on a need to know basis .
1  Organisations connecting to the EHRi  and organisations hosting components of the EHRi must not collect PHI by misleading or deceiving patients or persons or healthcare providers about the purposes for which information is being collected .
1  Rationale\: Personal information must not be collected by unfair or illegal means .
1  The antidote is fully informing patients or persons and providing appropriate notices of intended purposes for data collection  use  and disclosure .
1  When organisations identify the purposes for which they collect PHI (Privacy Requirement 5) and seek the appropriate consent for these purposes (Privacy Requirement 8)  it is imperative that they then only use  disclose and retain information for these purposes .
0  In many cases in health care  the content of records of PHI  as well as record retention periods  are mandated by statute  regulations and various bylaws for healthcare professionals .43 .
1  Organisations connecting to the EHRi and organisations hosting components of the EHRi must only use or disclose PHI for purposes consistent with those for which it was collected  except with the consent of the patient or person or as permitted or required by law .46 .
1  Rationale\: The Alberta Health Information Protection Act  Manitoba Personal Health Information Protection Act and Ontario Personal Health Information Act all require that custodians of PHI only collect  use or disclose as much PHI as is reasonably necessary to carry out the identified purposes .
1  Theses statutes typically permit or require a number of uses and disclosures of PHI related to provision of healthcare  supporting the operation of the healthcare system  or ensuring public health;47 such legislative provisions vary by jurisdiction .
1  These requirements will greatly assist in operationalizing the limitation of use and disclosure of this PH to authorized users with appropriate roles and privileges .
1  Rationale\: Specific legislation requires organisations to record access  modifications  and disclosures of PHI .49 Where such accesses  uses and disclosures fall outside of what is permitted by the EHRi  individuals accountable for privacy compliance need to be alerted .
0  Logs of access  modification and disclosure will themselves contain confidential information and must therefore be made both secure and tamper-proof .
1  Organisations hosting components of the EHRi and organisations connecting to the EHRi should notify patients or persons when it is determined that his or her PHI has been inappropriately accessed  used or disclosed in accordance with applicable laws  regulations and organisational policies and procedures .
0  The EHRi  POS systems connected to the EHRi  organisations connecting to the EHRi  and organisations hosting components of the EHRi\: must retain PHI in accordance with record-keeping requirements outlined in legislation; and .
0  The goal for healthcare organisations is to have PHI that is sufficiently accurate  complete and up-to-date to minimize the possibility that inappropriate PHI may be used to make a decision about a patient or person .
1  The EHRi  POS systems connected to the EHRi  organisations connecting to the EHRi and organisations hosting components of the EHRi must take reasonable steps or make a reasonable effort to\: ensure that PHI is as accurate  complete  and up-to-date as is necessary for the purposes for which it is to be used  including disclosures of PHI to third parties; and .
0  The EHRi  POS systems connected to the EHRi  organisations connecting to the EHRi and organisations hosting components of the EHRi must take reasonable steps or make a reasonable effort to\: accurately identify a patient or person when accessing or modifying his or her PHI .
0  In addition  it is of critical importance for patient safety and a number of other reasons  including the overall success of the EHRS  that EHRi users accurately identify patients or persons prior to accessing or modifying their PHI .
1  The EHRi  organisations connecting to the EHRi  and organisations hosting components of the EHRi must protect PHI  through the application of appropriate security safeguards  against loss or theft  as well as unauthorized access  disclosure  copying  use  or modification .
0  Concern for physical and system security has always been at the core of data protection and it will be of special importance in a developed electronic health record system  since the risks of a breach of security can be so devastating for the patient or person .
1  The EHRi must provide functions for marking records of selected patients or persons52 and subsequently making accesses to such data subject to mandatory auditing by the individual accountable for privacy compliance in the organisation .
0  Rationale\: This requirement greatly facilitates the determination of suspicious or wrongful use of access privileges with regard to patients who are high profile or whose confidentiality is otherwise especially at risk .
1  It may therefore be prudent to place additional audit controls on these records to protect patient privacy .
0  The EHRi should recognize this practical reality and facilitate the rapid and regular audit of access to these records (perhaps involving notification to a privacy officer on each access) .
0  Rather  the requirement ensures that the capability exists to rapidly identify prurient interest by users who lack a legitimate need-to-know .
0  All organisations hosting components of the EHRi or connecting to the EHRi must ensure that privacy education and training and regular updates in organisational privacy policies and procedures are provided to each permanent or temporary employee or third-party contractor who is a registered user of a POS connected to the EHRi or who has access to hosted components of the EHRi .
0  Rationale\: Organisations connecting to the EHRi and organisations hosting components of the EHRi need to make their employees aware of the importance of maintaining the privacy of PHI .
0  Training on an ongoing basis is absolutely essential for achieving all aspects of privacy .
0  Also  as a best practice  such training should be complemented by a readily available list of frequently asked privacy questions and answers .
1  The intent of this section is to make it possible for concerned members of the public to know the purposes for collecting  using  and disclosing PHI about them .
1  Organisations connecting to the EHRi  and organisations hosting components of the EHRi must make readily available to the public specific information about their policies and practices relating to the management of PHI .
1  Rationale\: In the spirit of openness that this privacy requirement embodies  members of the public must be able to acquire information about the management of PHI within the EHRi  at organisations connecting to the EHRi  or at organisations hosting components of the EHRi without unreasonable effort and in a form that is generally understandable to them .
1  It is now well established that patients have a legal right of access to their own health information  subject to limited exceptions in specified circumstances .53 .
1  Exceptions to the access requirements should be limited and specific .54 The reason for denying access should be provided to the patient or person .
0  For example  note that under the Alberta Health Information Act  a health information custodian that discloses PHI must make a note of the name of the person to whom the custodian disclosed the information; the date and purpose of the disclosure; and a description of the information disclosed .
0  The information must typically be retained for a period of 10 years following the date of disclosure .
1  The patient has a right of access to this information .
1  Inform a patient or person of the existence  use and disclosure60 of his or her PHI and shall give the patient or person direct access to that PHI where such access is not prohibited by legislation;61 .
1  Respond to requests for access to a patient or persons PHI within a reasonable time and make it available in a form that is generally understandable; and .
0  Allow a patient or person to challenge the accuracy and completeness of his or her PHI and have it amended as appropriate .
0  Patients or persons thus have a right to check that the information being used to treat them is accurate .
0  As discussed further below  the patient or person also has a right to challenge factual errors in particular (see Privacy Requirement 25) .
1  This right of access includes as well the right of the patient or person to be told what information the organisation holds about him or her and how it has been used .
0  Some corrections  deletions  or amendments will have a particular relevance to the ongoing healthcare of a patient or person  and they should be made known appropriately .63 Fortunately  a developed electronic health record system will automatically distribute the most up to date information when it is required for authorized purposes .
1  Organisations connecting to the EHRi  and organisations hosting components of the EHRi must give patients or persons the right to address a challenge concerning compliance with these requirements to the designated individual or individuals specified in Privacy Requirement 1 .
1  Rationale\: To give effect to privacy requirements like Privacy Requirement 3 and Privacy Requirement 7 patients must be able to challenge an organisations compliance with those requirements .
1  Put easily accessible and simple-to-use procedures in place to receive and respond to complaints or inquiries about their policies and practices relating to the handling of PHI .
1  Inform complainants and inquirers of the existence of these procedures .
0  Treat all received complaints as confidential .
0  The preparation of Frequently Asked Questions and making them readily available is an important first step in avoiding complaints and questions in the first instance .
0  Even if healthcare organisations seek to manage complaints locally and internally by sophisticated mechanisms for their resolution  they should still inform complainants if they have a right to make a privacy complaint to the provincial or territorial Information and Privacy Commissioner (or equivalent) .64 .
0  Organisations connecting to the EHRi and organisations hosting components of the EHRi must investigate all privacy related complaints .
0  If a complaint is found to be justified  the EHRi  organisations connecting to the EHRi and organisations hosting components of the EHRi should take appropriate measures  including  if necessary  amending their policies and practices and notifying the complainant of actions taken .
0  Since so many aspects of data protection are now regulated by detailed laws and regulations  a number of complaints will be answered by informing the complainant of what the law requires an organisation to do in specific circumstances .
0  The objectives of organising information security are to\: maintain the security of organisational information processing facilities and information assets accessed by third parties; and .
0  The objectives of organising information security are to\: maintain the security of information when the responsibility for information processing has been outsourced to another organisation .
0  Information security responsibilities may include one or more of the following\: developing and implementing security awareness training programs (see Security Requirement 16) .
0  Information security responsibilities may include one or more of the following\: reviewing audit logs (see Security Requirement 52) .
0  PHI flowing from one jurisdiction to another must do so in an environment where a minimum level of protection is afforded regardless of which jurisdiction the information finds itself .
0  The following are important characteristics of information assets within healthcare\: The confidentiality of PHI is often largely subjective  rather than objective; which is to say that ultimately only the data subject (i .e .  the patient) can make a proper determination of the relative confidentiality of various fields or grouping of data .
0  For example  a patient or person escaping from an abusive relationship may consider her new address and phone number to be much more confidential than clinical data about setting her broken arm .
0  The following are important characteristics of information assets within healthcare\: The confidentiality of PHI is context dependent .
0  For example  the name and address of a patient or person in a list of admissions to a hospitals emergency department may not be considered especially confidential by that patient; yet the same name and address in a list of admissions to a clinic treating sexual impotency may be considered highly confidential by that patient .
0  The following are important characteristics of information assets within healthcare\: The confidentiality of PHI can shift over the lifetime of a patients record .
0  For example  changing societal attitudes over the last 20 years have resulted in many patients no longer considering their sexual orientation to be confidential .
1  Because one cannot predict the sensitivity of a given element of PHI through all its uses and phases of its life cycle that all PHI should be subject to careful protection at all times .
0  In light of the above  a strong argument can be made to uniformly classify PHI as confidential .
0  All organisations connecting to the EHRi or hosting components of the EHRi must classify data contained within a patient or persons EHR as confidential PHI .
0  Rationale\: This requirement ensures that users are fully aware that all PHI is considered confidential .
1  It also ensures that there is no uncertainty about the extent of the information to which the privacy requirements apply .
0  As discussed above  this requirement also precludes graded shades of confidentiality (e .g .\: lab data more confidential than medication profile  or patient address data less confidential than billing data) and concomitant graded shades of security .
0  All data contained within a patient or persons EHR is to be considered confidential and its confidentiality uniformly protected .
0  Uniformity of confidentiality is also a prerequisite for any realistic sharing of data across jurisdictions .
0  Note that while all PHI is uniformly classified as confidential  other requirements allow for records of at risk patient or persons to be specially tagged so that access to their records can be closely monitored .
0  Displaying this labelling to the user upon logging into the POS application (perhaps as part of an acceptable use policy) .
0  Rationale\: This requirement ensures that all healthcare providers and support staff are aware that the specific information they are handling is confidential PHI .
0  This is especially important where the information is contained in email  faxes or other documents which may contain a mixture of confidential and non-confidential information .
0  The objectives of human resource security are to\: reduce risks of human error  theft  fraud or misuse of facilities .
0  The objectives of human resource security are to\: ensure that users are aware of information security threats and concerns  and are equipped to support the corporate security policy in the course of their normal work .
0  The objectives of human resource security are to\: minimize the damage from security incidents and malfunctions; and .
0  The objectives of human resource security are to\: learn from such incidents .
0  These roles must be defined in a standardised or harmonized manner so as to ensure future interoperability of authentication services between POS systems and the EHRi .
0  User responsibilities include\: maintaining the confidentiality of PHI .
0  User responsibilities include\: not sharing user IDs  passwords  or other means of accessing the EHRi with other users (see Security Requirement 55  Security Requirement 64  and Security Requirement 71); and .
0  User responsibilities include\: following appropriate procedures when using mobile devices or when working off-site or at home (see Security Requirement 21  Security Requirement 34  Security Requirement 73  and Security Requirement 74) .
0  All organisations hosting components of the EHRi or connecting to the EHRi must verify the identity and address of each permanent or temporary staff member or contractor who will become a registered user of a POS connected to the EHRi or who will have access to hosted components of the EHRi .
0  A simple verification of name and address from reliable identification documents (drivers license for example) suffices to meet the requirement .
0  Such verification of identity documents helps to ensure that effective prosecution or litigation can be brought against individuals who can be shown  as a result of analyzing audit logs  to have abused their access privileges .
0  All organisations hosting components of the EHRi or connecting to the EHRi must ensure that information security education and training and regular updates in organisational security policies and procedures are provided to each permanent or temporary employee or third-party contractor who is a registered user of a POS connected to the EHRi or who has access to hosted components of the EHRi .
0  Rationale\: Training in security awareness is essential .
0  All users need to be made aware of the confidentiality of PHI  and the procedures required for maintaining this confidentiality .
0  As well  users should be made aware of the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of information that refers to identifiable healthcare providers .
0  Staff who are involved in providing or maintaining security services related to the EHRi should be provided with access to appropriate security alerts and other technical security information to raise and maintain awareness of security threats .
0  Finally  it should be noted that while the requirement for training users on data protection is stated in Privacy Requirement 22b  there is an obvious expectation that privacy and security training be treated together in a coherently and consistent fashion .
0  Rationale\: Effective termination of user access privileges is a minimum requirement but in the absence of single sign-on capabilities and shared authentication services  it is not always effectually handled .
0  The objectives of physical and environmental security are to\: prevent unauthorized access  damage and interference to business premises and information .
0  The objectives of physical and environmental security are to\: prevent loss  damage or compromise of assets and interruption to business activities; and .
0  All organisations hosting components of the EHRi must use security perimeters to protect areas that contain information processing facilities supporting EHRi servers  applications or data .
0  These secure areas must be protected by appropriate entry controls to ensure that only authorized personnel are allowed access .
0  Rationale\: Perimeter security of servers and other aspects of application hosting is a minimum requirement for ensuring the availability and integrity of these important applications and data and for ensuring the confidentiality of information in storage that is not already secured cryptographically .
0  In turn  controlling access is a minimum requirement of perimeter security .
0  The most detailed provisions are found in Manitobas health information legislation  which require the trustee to ensure that PHI is maintained in a designated area or areas that is subject to appropriate security safeguards; and to limit physical access to designated areas to authorized persons .
0  All organisations hosting components of the EHRi must protect sites and equipment supporting the EHRi to reduce the risks from environmental threats and hazards .
0  All organisations hosting components of the EHRi must protect equipment supporting the EHRi from power failures and other disruptions caused by failures in supporting utilities .
0  Rationale\: This is a minimum requirement for protecting system availability in the 24 by 7 operational environment of healthcare .
0  Healthcare demands high system availability  especially in those instances where disruptions of supporting utilities are caused by disasters that themselves result in injuries and therefore place a heavy burden on emergency health services .
0  All organisations hosting components of the EHRi must ensure that equipment supporting the EHRi\: is not used outside their premises without appropriate safeguards and prior authorization by the organisations management  and .
0  All organisations hosting components of the EHRi must ensure that equipment supporting the EHRi\: is repaired or serviced by authorized personnel only .
0  All organisations hosting components of the EHRi or connecting to the EHRi must securely overwrite or else destroy all media containing EHRi application software  PHI  or security critical system data when no longer required for use .
0  Legal requirements follow from the Manitoba regulations pursuant to Personal Health Information Act\: to ensure the security of PHI in electronic form when the computer hardware or removable electronic storage media on which it has been recorded is being disposed of or used for another purpose .
0  All organisations hosting components of the EHRi must not allow equipment  data or software supporting the EHRi to be removed without authorization by the organisations management .
0  All organisations hosting components of the EHRi must control changes to information processing facilities and systems that support the EHRi by means of a formal and structured change control process to ensure the appropriate control of host applications and systems .
0  Rules for the migration of software from development to operational status must be defined and documented by the organisation hosting the affected application(s) .
0  All organisations hosting components of the EHRi must monitor capacity demands and project future capacity requirements to ensure adequate processing power and storage will be made available to host those EHRi components .
0  As stated in ISO or IEC 17799\:2000  managers should use this (capacity) information to identify and avoid potential bottlenecks that might present a threat to system security or user services  and plan appropriate remedial action .
0  Store the backed-up data in a physically secure environment off-site (see section 5 .7) .
0  Rationale\: Several technologies are available to ensure the confidentiality of data during storage  such as encryption or the use of de-identified data .
0  Rationale\: Interception of confidential information is a serious risk and its alteration in transit has severe consequences .
0  Providing for the confidentiality and integrity of PHI transmitted by the EHRi is a minimum requirement .
0  For example  Ontarios health information legislation requires custodians to transfer PHI in a secure manner .
0  Manitobas health information legislation requires a trustee who uses electronic means to request disclosure and to respond to requests for disclosure to implement procedures to prevent the interception of information by unauthorized persons .
0  The EHRi must protect the source and destination of the message against masquerade during data transmission of PHI to maintain its confidentiality and integrity .
0  Rationale\: This is a minimum requirement to protect against the threat of masquerade .
0  This requirement facilitates trusted end-to-end information flow and would require that a technology such as digital signatures  dedicated lines  or virtual private networks be implemented to protect source and destination .
0  Where appropriate  the EHRi must obtain acknowledgement of receipt during data transmission of PHI to ensure that the transmitted data was received .
0  Rationale\: Message acknowledgement via handshaking or other methods is a minimum requirement to ensure complete receipt of information at its destination .
0  All organisations hosting components of the EHRi must and organisations connecting to the EHRi should ensure that PHI and other security critical data stored on removable media are\: encrypted while the media are in transit to protect the datas confidentiality and integrity; and Admin Requirement Tech Requirement .
0  All organisations hosting components of the EHRi must and organisations connecting to the EHRi should ensure that PHI and other security critical data stored on removable media are\: protected from theft  where appropriate  while the media are in transit to protect the datas availability .
0  All organisations connecting to the EHRi or hosting components of the EHRi should destroy  permanently erase or make anonymous PHI contained on media that are no longer required .
0  Note that this requirement refers to disposal of media  not the deletion of records (i .e .  it presumes that relevant data have been copied to other media or exist in other systems prior to media disposal .
1  All organisations hosting components of the EHRi must protect electronic media containing PHI critical system data or security critical system data  including user registration data  by one or more of the following means\: securely de-identifying the PHI it contains.
0  Protecting its confidentiality is essential to maintaining the trust of healthcare providers (who  for example  do not want to be sent marketing materials from spammers gaining access to a poorly secured list of contact details for users) .
1  While physical protection of data storage will always be essential to protect system availability  de-identification should be seriously considered and encryption should be seriously considered in the design of any new system .
0  All organisations hosting components of the EHRi must monitor the status and location of media containing unencrypted EHRi data or security critical data  including user registration data  and ensure this data remains physically protected .
0  Of all security requirements protecting PHI  one of the most important is audit and logging .
0  These ensure accountability for patients or persons entrusting their information to electronic health record systems and also ensure that users will conform to policies on acceptable use of the EHRi .
0  The EHRi must create a secure audit record each time a user\: accesses  creates or updates71 PHI of a patient or person via the EHRi .
0  The EHRi must create a secure audit record each time a user\: overrides the consent directives of a patient or person via the EHRi .
0  The EHRi must create a secure audit record each time a user\: accesses  via the EHRi  data that is locked or masked by instruction of a patient or person; or .
0  Accesses  creates or updates registration data on an EHRi user .
0  Audit records should contain the necessary information to answer the following questions\: or a given element of PHI  what users have accessed  created or updated it and when?
0  Audit information may be stored in POS systems  as well as in the EHRi .
0  To construct an authoritative transcript of which users have accessed a patient or persons PHI or what PHI a user has accessed  all audit records will need to be accessible and hence audit requirements meeting the strictest existing jurisdictional legal requirements are essential to support full interoperability across jurisdictions .
0  Interoperability also contributes to the rationale for consistent and uniform logging .
0  The EHRi must be capable of displaying the former content of a record at any point in the past  as well the associated details of who entered  accessed or modified the data and at what time .
0  Maintenance of data integrity necessitate this type of logging .
0  Some jurisdictions within Canada also allow patients or persons to attach a statement of disagreement to an element of information that a patient believes to be incorrect (and where the healthcare provider who authored it does not) .
0  The EHRi must be able to facilitate the existence of such statements of disagreement concerning the accuracy or inaccuracy of a data element .
0  All POS systems connected to the EHRi should be capable of displaying the former content of a record at any point in the past  as well and the associated details of who entered  accessed or modified the data and at what time) .
0  Rationale\: Such an audit log allows reconstruction of the state of any EHR stored within the POS system at any point in time .
0  Maintenance of data integrity and effective logging of changes to PHI necessitate this type of audit logging .
0  The EHRi must be capable of determining all past recipients of data from an EHR and must be capable of notifying them if data in the EHR is subsequently amended .
0  Though logging of all past recipients can quickly grow huge  the cost of online storage continues to fall by half each year and even terabyte storage capacity is no longer prohibitively expensive for many healthcare organisations .
0  The EHRi may be required to keep a record of all cross-jurisdictional transfers of PHI .
0  For example  Albertas health information legislation requires a custodian that discloses PHI to make a note of the name of the person to whom the custodian disclosed the information; the date and purpose of the disclosure; and a description of the information disclosed .
0  All POS systems connected to the EHRi must record in an audit log every instance of a user accessing  updating  or archiving PHI .
0  The EHRi audit log and the audit logs of POS systems connecting to the EHRi must contain\: the user ID of the accessing user .
0  The EHRi audit log and the audit logs of POS systems connecting to the EHRi must contain\: the role the user is exercising74 .
0  The EHRi audit log and the audit logs of POS systems connecting to the EHRi must contain\: the organisation of the accessing user (at least in those cases where an individual accesses information on behalf of more than one organisation) .
0  The EHRi audit log and the audit logs of POS systems connecting to the EHRi must contain\: the patient ID of the data subject (patient or person) .
0  The EHRi audit log and the audit logs of POS systems connecting to the EHRi must contain\: the function performed by the accessing user .
0  The EHRi audit log and the audit logs of POS systems connecting to the EHRi must contain\: a time stamp .
0  The EHRi audit log and the audit logs of POS systems connecting to the EHRi must contain\: in the case of access override to blocked or masked records or portions of records  a reason for the override  as chosen by the user making the access; and .
0  The EHRi audit log and the audit logs of POS systems connecting to the EHRi must contain\: in the case of changes to consent directives made by a substitute decision-maker  the identity of the decision-maker .
0  All organisations hosting components of the EHRi or connecting to the EHRi must retain75 the audit log for the entire retention period of the records audited  to enable investigations to be carried out when necessary and to provide evidence where necessary .
1  Note that Albertas health information legislation requires a custodian that discloses PHI to make a note of the name of the person to whom the custodian disclosed the information; the date and purpose of the disclosure; and a description of the information disclosed .
0  The information must be retained for a period of 10 years following the date of disclosure .
0  Audit logs must be retained in a form that allows analysis of log contents .
0  Security Requirement 45 Continuously Logging the EHRi EHRi audit logging must be operational at all times .
0  Rationale\: This is a minimum requirement and ensures logging cannot be turned off while the system is in operation .
0  The EHRi must provide automated analysis tools to assist system auditors in the detection and prevention of system misuse (e .g . data harvesting) .
0  Rationale\: This requirement mandates that automated tools actively look for anomalous patterns of access .
0  Such active intrusion detection is an essential feature of robust security systems .
0  Unlike audit logging itself  the analysis tools need not be continuously available .
0  It suffices that such tools be available when needed .
0  The EHRi must be capable of identifying all patients or persons whose records have been accessed or modified by a given user over a given period of time .
0  Rationale\: This requirement greatly facilitates the determination of suspicious or wrongful use of access privileges .
0  The EHRi must provide functions for analyzing logs and audit trails to allow the identification of all users who have accessed or modified such record(s) over a given period of time .
0  As noted in the discussion of Privacy Requirement 22a  the records of certain patients or persons (e .g . celebrities  politicians  and newsmakers) may be at elevated risk of access by those who do not have a need-to-know .
0  The EHRi must secure access to audit records and must safeguard access to system audit tools and audit trails to prevent misuse or compromise .
0  Requirement Requirement Rationale\: This is a minimum requirement for maintaining system integrity and the confidentiality of information contained in the audit log .
0  Confidentiality is critical since a third party obtaining access to such a log might infer PHI from audit log entries (e .g .  from a log entry indicating update of a patient record by a user at a cancer care centre  it could be inferred that the patient has cancer) .
0  The EHRi must provide appropriate security measures to protect audit logs from tampering .
0  All organisations hosting components of the EHRi must subject system logs and audit logs to detailed review; on a regular and ongoing basis .
0  Admin Requirement Rationale\: Audit trails are of questionable utility if not reviewed and so periodic review ought to be a minimum requirement .
0  Note that analysis tools that facilitate audit trail review are mandated in Security Requirement 46  Security Requirement 47  Security Requirement 48 and Security Requirement 49 .
0  Review of audit logs should be done by one or more responsible individuals assigned the task as in Security Requirement 3 .
0  Audit log review can be greatly aided by software such as intrusion detection systems that look for unusual patterns of use and facilitate exception reporting .
0  Note that Manitobas health information legislation requires a trustee to regularly review audit trails to detect any security breaches .
0  If the system claims to be available 24 by 7 then the system shall have ability to run a backup concurrently with the operation of the application .
0  The objectives of this section of ISO or IEC 17799 are to\: control access to information .
0  The objectives of this section of ISO or IEC 17799 are to\: prevent unauthorized access to information systems .
0  The objectives of this section of ISO or IEC 17799 are to\: ensure the protection of networked services .
0  The objectives of this section of ISO or IEC 17799 are to\: prevent unauthorized computer access .
0  The objectives of this section of ISO or IEC 17799 are to\: detect unauthorized activities; and .
0  All organisations hosting components of the EHRi must develop an Access Control Policy for the EHRi .
0  The accurate capture of a users enduring professional credentials (e .g .\: Dr . Joan Smith  Cardiologist) possibly and possibly job title (e .g .\: Susan Jones  Medical Receptionist); and .
0  In what follows  the identification and registration of users includes\: the proper assignment of a user id .
0  The distinction can best be illustrated operationally\: ideally  users should be identified once (at initial registration)  their registration optionally subject to periodic renewal as appropriate  and their privileges managed on an ongoing basis (with changes being made as required by their work) .
1  While this request for information may be recorded  the accessing user remains anonymous (many Web sites offering information on pregnancy  AIDS or other public health topics operate in this fashion) .
0  All organisations connecting to the EHRi must subject potential users of POS systems that connect to the EHRi to a formal user registration process .
0  These user registration procedures must ensure\: that the level of user identification that is provided is consistent with the assurance required  given the value of the information assets and the functions that will become available to the user .
0  These user registration procedures must ensure\: that each potential user has a legitimate relationship with the organisation .
0  These user registration procedures must ensure\: that each potential user has a legitimate need to access PHI via the EHRi .
0  Rationale\: This requirement follows directly from Privacy Requirement 13 and from the legal requirements of several jurisdictions that those accessing and updating PHI be identified .
0  For example  in Manitoba  the identity of the person seeking to use PHI must be verified as a person the trustee of the information has authorized to use the information .
0  This requirement also implies that  for example  users who are assigned roles that can access PHI must be identified more rigorously than users who can only access  for example  anonymised data .
0  Effective use of technical means (e .g .  online registration via the Internet  backed by pre-established databases of shared secrets and roles drawn from provider registries) may greatly enhance the registration process .
0  All organisations connecting to the EHRi must ensure that users of POS systems that connect to the EHRi are assigned an identifier (user ID) that  in combination with other identifiers (e .g .  facility identifiers  jurisdictional identifiers  etc .) can uniquely identify the user within the EHRi .
0  POS systems must support the unique identification of users .
0  Rationale\: This requirement facilitates system-wide audit and trusted end-to-end security .
0  All organisations connecting to the EHRi must ensure that the registration of users of POS systems that connect to the EHRi is time limited (after which  the users registration will need to be renewed) .
0  Note that renewal of registration is not synonymous with re-identification (i .e . in a well-designed registration process  users who have been effectively identified once do not necessarily need to be reidentified from scratch when their registration is renewed) .
0  Some POS systems will automatically support this requirement  while others will need to be supplemented by manual processes (e .g .\: an annual review of users and whether their access is still merited) .
0  However it is achieved  time limited user registration can be an effective strategy to prevent continued access by users whose employment is terminated or whose contracts have ended .
0  Note that revocation of specific access privileges is a separate issue from time limited user registration (which ensures that all access is terminated after a period of time  unless registration is explicitly renewed) .
0  Rationale\: This requirement and the previous one are a hedge against the misadministration of users who are initially granted high levels of access and then transferred to positions where such levels of access are no longer needed .
0  This requirement  together with requirement Security Requirement 56 ensures that user registration details (for example  a contact phone number or email address) remain current .
0  For the EHRi  the overarching objective is to provide security controls to ensure that access to specific records  and  where appropriate  to specific elements of PHI within those records  is granted only to those EHRi users with a legitimate need-to-know .
0  A users need-to-know can be determined in one of more of the following ways\: through general work assignments (e .g .\: when a physician fills in for another physician who is sick) .
0  A users need-to-know can be determined in one of more of the following ways\: through associative relationships (e .g .\: a physician in a primary care group should be able to access the records of patient or persons seen by physicians in that primary care group) .
0  A users need-to-know can be determined in one of more of the following ways\: through explicit delegation (e .g .\: a nurse hired by a primary care practice should be able to access the records of patients or persons whose family physicians make up the clinic) .
0  A users need-to-know can be determined in one of more of the following ways\: through referral (e .g .\: a physician refers a patient or person to a specialist)  and .
0  A users need-to-know can be determined in one of more of the following ways\: through explicit ad-hoc assertions by an individual care provider (e .g .\: in the provision of emergency medicine) .
0  In the subsections that follow  several access control methodologies are discussed that  when taken together  ensure the confidentiality and integrity of PHI by restricting user access to those with a legitimate need-to-know .
0  These access control methodologies are\: role-based access control  which relies upon the professional credentials and job titles of users established during registration to restrict users to just those access privileges that are required to fulfil one or more well-defined roles .
0  These access control methodologies are\: workgroup based access control  which relies upon the assignment of users to workgroups (such as clinical teams) to determine which records they can access; and .
0  These access control methodologies are\: discretionary access control  which relies upon users with a legitimate relationship to a patient or person's EHR (a family physician  say) to confer access to other users who have no previously established relationship to that patient or person's EHR (a specialist  say) .
0  Role-based access control limits the access of a user to specific portions of records (e .g .\: demographic data)and to specific functions that can be performed on those portions of records (e .g .\: update contact details in the demographic data) .
0  It is not typically used to limit access to the records of specific patients or persons  as this is the task of workgroup based access control possibly and possibly discretionary access control .
0  Note that patients or persons are not typically system users  although patients or persons who are able to access all or part of their data online (e .g .  via a portal) would indeed be system users who are exercising the role of Patient .
0  The EHRi and all POS systems connected to the EHRi must support role-based access control (RBAC) capable of mapping each user to one or more roles  and each role to one or more system functions .
0  Rationale\: As a practical matter  users of POS systems connected to the EHRi (and there will be many thousands of them) cannot individually be mapped to system functions upon user registration in order to control the extent of their user access privileges .
0  Rather  users must be mapped to roles  and then the roles mapped to system functions .
0  There are significant issues related to using RBAC to support an interoperable EHR that must be resolved before the EHRi can make full and effective use of RBAC .
0  All POS systems connected to the EHRi must ensure that each user will access applications and services of the EHRi in a single role (i .e .  users who have been registered with more than one non-overlapping role must designate a single role during each EHRi session) .
0  For example  a general practitioner who works in the Emergency Department of a rural hospital one day a week (and who has emergency override privileges while on duty) must clearly indicate to the POS system when she is acting in this capacity and must do so prior to accessing a patient or persons EHR via the EHRi .
0  Another example would be an EHRi user accessing EHRi records as a clinician and also sometimes as a researcher .
0  A hierarchical organisation of roles  accommodating users who frequently switch between dual roles that are both related to clinical care  would greatly reduce user frustration from needlessly having to switch between one role and the other .
0  Properly designed roles will ensure that users rarely  if ever  have switch roles by initiating a new session .
0  Workgroup-based access control allows users to be assigned to working groups such as\: organisations (e .g .\: a primary care clinic or a primary health care team in a rural community) .
0  Workgroup-based access control allows users to be assigned to working groups such as\: organisational units (e .g .\: the emergency department of a hospital)  or .
0  Users can then rapidly be given access to all the records of patients in the care of that team .
0  Rather  workgroup-based access control allows a user with a given role (say  family physician) to exercise the access privileges of that role upon all the records accessible by members of the working group (say  patients or persons in a primary care clinic) .
0  The EHRi and all POS systems connected to the EHRi must be capable of assigning users to working groups and of granting access to records based on working groups .
0  Rationale\: It is unreasonable to assume that all physicians will be able  via the EHRi  to view the EHR of all Canadian patients or persons .
0  At a minimum  VIPs and other selected patients will require restriction of their EHRs to just those individuals who are known members of their healthcare team .
1  This is a privacy protective feature that all Canadians might reasonably expect to protect their PHI from potential access by any arbitrary healthcare provider registered to use the EHRi .
0  In addition  there may be a need to maintain a list of one or more workgroups to which the user is a member .
0  Examples might include surgical teams at a specific hospital or physicians with admitting privileges at a specific hospital .
0  Such workgroups would enable a users relationship with a patient or person to be inferred from existng relationships between the patient or person and other members of the workgroup .
0  It is expected that POS systems will track such assignments where necessary (e .g .  in a hospital information system) and that the EHRi will rely on this data where available .
0  The EHRi and all POS systems connected to the EHRi must support the revocation of user access privileges in a timely manner; i .e . to immediately prevent the user from logging on  after access privileges have been revoked .
0  Revocation of user access privileges does not in itself alter the status of data that the user has already entered .
0  Punitive revocation of a users access privileges may need to be accompanied by a review of data entered by the user; such determination must be made on a case-by-case basis .
0  Rationale\: This requirement ensures that user access privileges to the EHRi can be immediately and systematically suspended if there are grounds to do so .
0  The owner of a file is free to grant access rights to the file to others (hence discretionary access control) .
0  In healthcare  a user who has full access to a record (a responsible physician  say) may need to rapidly grant access to a user who has never had a previous legitimate relationship with the patient (a specialist  say) .
0  The patient may not be present or even conscious when this access control decision is made .
1  Discretionary access control occupies a middle ground between the two extremes of  on the one hand  allowing all users in a given role access to a huge pool of electronic health records; and on the other hand  requiring explicit consent for each user to access each record .
0  The EHRi and all POS systems connected to the EHRi\: must be capable of associating users (healthcare providers) with the records of patients or persons and allowing future access based on this association; i .e .  they must be capable of granting discretionary access to records based on a registered user with legitimate and pre-existing access to a patients record(s) granting access rights for that (those) record(s) to another registered user .
0  The EHRi and all POS systems connected to the EHRi\: must not allow users to grant other users access to a record if the granting users themselves do not possess such access with respect to the record; and .
0  Note that granting other users access to a record does not over-ride the role based access control restrictions of those other users .
0  As noted above  discretionary access control does not trump role based access control .
0  For example  a family physician can grant another physician (a specialist  say) full access to one of her patients records .
0  The specialist might later use that access to write an e-prescription for the patient .
0  However  if the physician grants access to a nurse  the nurse cannot later write an e-prescription for the patient  as role based access control would typically prevent nurses from exercising such a function .
0  The EHRi must and POS systems connected to the EHRi should provide functionality that can report  for a given user\: which records the user can access .
0  The EHRi must and POS systems connected to the EHRi should provide functionality that can report  for a given user\: which portions of the record the user can access .
0  Rationale\: Past experience with popular operating system software has shown how difficult it can be to determine whether a given user can access a given record or exercise a given privilege unless there is an explicit facility within the system to answer such questions .
0  The lack of such a facility can make it extremely difficult to detect and correct errors in the assignment of user access privileges .
0  Organisations connecting to the EHRi must define user responsibilities  make users aware of them and have users agree to them as part of an acceptable use agreement .
0  Rationale\: Acceptable use agreements are an important part of ensuring that users are aware of their responsibilities (and hence help to support Security Requirement 16) as well as provide the basis for legal redress if users abuse their access rights .
0  Administrative overhead can be substantially reduced when electronic agreements are used instead of paper .
0  Organisations hosting components of the EHRi must ensure that all EHRi connections to remote servers and applications are authenticated .
0  Rationale\: This helps to ensure that applications containing PHI are not compromised by masquerading remote servers possibly and possibly applications .
0  Organisations hosting components of the EHRi must securely control access to diagnostic ports and services on networks hosting those components .
0  Rationale\: Network security plays a fundamental role in preventing unauthorized access to servers  data  and other information assets .
0  An appropriate level of network security needs to be applied to protect EHRi resources .
0  The intent of this requirement is to separate  for example  the hosting of healthcare applications containing PHI from servers hosting applications unrelated to PHI .
0  Network firewalls are a typical example of how network segregation is achieved .
0  Organisations hosting components of the EHRi must have routing controls76 on networks hosting those components to ensure that data flows across the network perimeter do not breach the organisations access control policy .
0  Rationale\: This requirement is intended to protect against a variety of denial of service attacks .
0  Most networks today have at least rudimentary routing control implemented in firewalls .
0  Organisations hosting components of the EHRi  must restrict and control the use of system utility programs .
0  Where appropriate  the EHRi should restrict connection duration to EHRi application services to provide additional security for access to those applications .
0  The length of time to maintain a connect varies with the nature of the application and the types of connections (e .g .\: server to server or client to server) .
0  Given the messaging framework defined in the EHRS Blueprint  connections to an EHRi would typically not last more then a few minutes .
0  The EHRi and all POS systems connected to the EHRi must robustly authenticate users .
0  Rationale\: Uncontrolled user access is a frequent enabler of security breaches .
0  Moreover  some level of uniformity in the strength of authentication will likely be needed to support cross-jurisdictional interoperability .
0  Nevertheless  some basic security requirements remain for the protection of workstations in healthcare  as these can often be found in areas that can be accessed by patients and other unauthorized personnel .
0  All POS systems connected to the EHRi must protect unattended workstations against an unauthorized person taking the opportunity to use the workstation while the POS is active  either with automatic timeout after a period of inactivity or by placing the workstations in a physically secure area .
1  Proper positioning of workstations also plays a role in ensuring that the patients or persons cannot see the details of other peoples records .
0  Organisations hosting components of the EHRi or connecting to the EHRi must protect wireless connections from unauthorized access or misuse .
0  Rationale\: Application of wireless networking to healthcare needs to be done securely to prevent interception and decryption of wireless network traffic and to protect against end-user masquerade  man-in-the-middle attacks  access point spoofing  session hijacking  and potentially denial of service .
0  All of these can be addressed through the use of encryption .
0  The objectives of information systems acquisition  development and maintenance security are to\: prevent loss  modification or misuse of user data in application systems .
0  The objectives of information systems acquisition  development and maintenance security are to\: protect the confidentiality  authenticity  availability and integrity of information .
0  Rationale\: Although painfully obvious  the need to uniquely identify patients or persons has significant consequences for the operation of the EHRi  including the need to manage multiple identifiers  possibly map those identifiers to a unique internal identifier  and merge records where it is determined that they both belong to the same individual and that separate records have been unintentionally created .
1  In addition to the unique patient identifiers referred to above  the EHRi might also support additional so-called meaningless but unique identifiers and to manage these internal identifiers separately from publicly available identifiers in order to provide for default depersonalization .
0  The EHRi and all POS systems connected to the EHRi must include  wherever feasible  measures to safeguard against user error by validating data input to ensure that it is correct and appropriate .
0  Input checks to detect the following errors\: out-of-range values .
0  Input checks to detect the following errors\: invalid characters in data fields .
0  Input checks to detect the following errors\: missing or incomplete data .
0  Input checks to detect the following errors\: exceeding upper and lower data volume limits .
0  Input checks to detect the following errors\: unauthorized or inconsistent control data .
0  Input checks to detect the following errors\: procedures for responding to validation errors .
0  All POS systems connected to the EHRi should ensure it is possible to check that hardcopy print-outs are complete (e .g .\: page 3 of 5) .
0  It prevents covert selective presentation of data .
0  To the extent that the EHRi supports the replacement of paper-based prescriptions  a facility for the application  recognition and verification of digital signatures will be among the services provided by the EHRi  as Canadian law requires that prescriptions be signed .77 Although the principle use of digital signatures would probably be for e-prescribing  there are many other less common situations where the signature of a physician might be required upon a form (for example  death certificates) .
0  Processing of these other paper based forms would also benefit from augmentation with e-forms and the concomitant use of digital signatures by physicians .
0  Finally  digital signatures play an important role in providing so-called security assertions reliable attestations that a given user or system has a given attribute .
0  In addition to physicians  many other users might benefit from a digital signature capability; for example  registration clerks  administrators  and users renewing their access or requesting changes in registration details .
0  As well  digital signatures can themselves form the basis of an effective two-factor authentication methodology as per Security Requirement 71 (Robustly Authenticating Users)  and so can fulfil this function as well as provide for signature capability .
0  Regulations under the Food and Drug Act require that prescriptions be either in writing or verbal\: if the prescription is in writing  it has been signed and dated by the practitioner issuing the same and the signature of the practitioner where not known to the pharmacist  has been verified by him; or .
0  Regulations under the Food and Drug Act require that prescriptions be either in writing or verbal\: if the prescription is given verbally  the pharmacist has taken reasonable precaution to satisfy himself that the person giving the prescription is a practitioner .
0  Organisations hosting components of the EHRi must put procedures be in place to control the implementation of software and upgrades on operational systems hosting these components .
0  Admin Requirement Rationale\: Change control is a minimum requirement for protecting the security of operational systems .
0  Organisations hosting components of the EHRi must maintain control over access to program source libraries for EHRi components where such libraries are within the control of the organisation .
0  Organisations hosting components of the EHRi must take steps to test for and prevent the exploitation of published vulnerabilities in systems and software that host those component .
0  Rationale\: This requirement prevents the exploitation of known vulnerabilities in systems that have not been updated with currently available security patches .
0  It also mandates that security patches which fix known security problems either be applied when available or else effective alternative steps be taken to address the security problem .
0  Effective security vulnerability management of new or significantly upgraded systems and software should also include penetration testing .
0  The objectives of security incident management are to\: build a reporting infrastructure for reporting incidents and weakness; and .
0  The objectives of security incident management are to\: manage incidents and institute improvements to prevent their future occurrence .
0  The EHRi must and all POS systems connected to the EHRi should trigger a notification to the accountable person specified in Security Requirement 3 of every detected pattern of system misuse (see Security Requirement 46) .
0  Organisations hosting components of the EHRi must establish incident management responsibilities and procedures to ensure a quick  effective and orderly response to security incidents and to collect and preserve incident-related data such as audit trails  logs and other evidence .
1  Legal requirements also arise from the Ontario Regulations that require notifying a patient or person at the first reasonable opportunity if the patient or persons information is stolen  lost or accessed by unauthorized persons .
0  Organisations hosting components of the EHRi must put in place a managed process for developing and maintaining business continuity throughout the organisation  including\: developing a strategic plan  based on appropriate risk assessment  for the overall approach to business continuity .
0  Organisations hosting components of the EHRi must put in place a managed process for developing and maintaining business continuity throughout the organisation  including\: maintaining a unified framework of business continuity plans to ensure that all plans are consistent  and to identify priorities for testing and maintenance .
0  Written plans (item b) are a requirement of effective business continuity management .
0  Item c is intended to integrate business continuity planning in IT systems with broader plans to maintain services to patients .
0  Organisations hosting components of the EHRi will need multiple business continuity functions and they will all need to be addressed in a comprehensive manner to ensure the EHRi access and functionally are continually maintained .
0  Organisations hosting components of the EHRi must regularly test and maintain business continuity plans by regular reviews to ensure that they are up to date and effective .
0  Audit standards for the EHRi will be based on jurisdictional requirements and standards .
0  These issues included the following\: Emergency Override Privileges Can be Difficult to Determine In some cases  the role of emergency care provider may be situational .
0  These issues included the following\: Substitute Decision Makers May Require Identification Substitute decision makers may be required to make decision concerning treatment  as well to make decisions concerning the patient or persons consent directives .
0  For example  substitute decision maker would need to decide which other family members could be notified of a patients medical condition if the patient was unable to communicate or was incapable of making decisions on their own behalf .
0  In such situations  it may be necessary to verify the identity of the patient as well as the substitute decision maker .
0  These issues included the following\: Identification of Systems  Servers  and Applications How uniquely should such systems be identified?
0  These issues included the following\: Keeping PHI from System and Administrative Personnel EHRi system administrators may have access to PHI that they are not authorized to retrieve; either directly via system tools other than the application level user interface or via integration engines that process and exchange information .
0  System level testing  diagnosis and maintenance should be done  to the greatest extent possible  using test data  not actual PHI .
1  An EHRi that effectively encrypts such PHI during storage and when in transit could avoid these unintended disclosures to system personnel and other insiders (albeit with attendant overhead in administration and processing) but there are many other options as well  including decoupling of personal identifiers from healthcare information .80 .
0  These issues included the following\: Keeping PHI from Unauthorized Third Parties Unauthorized third parties may retrieve or even alter PHI in transit (e .g .  by intercepting unencrypted transmission of data)  in repositories (e .g .  by hacking into database repositories)  or in storage on secondary media (e .g .  by obtaining unencrypted data backups or data archives) .
0  This ensures that a user who does not work exclusively in an emergency department will not have access to emergency override functions while working in a non-emergency setting (e .g .  when providing family medicine in a physician practice) .
0  Users whose roles include a role with access to emergency override functions and who invokes that role in a non-emergency situation in order to exercise those emergency override functions may therefore be subject to disciplinary procedures based upon the evidence provided by the audit log .
0  Before relying on information provided by an EHR  healthcare providers need access to sufficient information to ensure that the patient or person matches the EHR) .
0  Some POS systems enhance security by including photo ID of the patient or person belonging to the record .
1  Such enhancements may themselves create privacy problems  as they potentially permit the implicit capture of facial characteristics such as race that are not included as fields of data .
0  The provision of emergency care and other situations in which adequate patient identification may not have been possible will inevitably create instances of multiple records for the same patient or person .
0  There must therefore be some capacity within the EHRi to merge multiple instances of patient records into a single record .
0  Such merging requires the greatest care and will therefore necessitate not only personnel trained in such merging  but may also require technical tools to better facilitate the integration of information from the original records into a unified whole .
0  Security Requirement 76 addresses this need for unique identification of patients or persons and for the ability to merge records that belong to the same patient or person .
0  Authentication technologies must be carefully chosen from among those that have a proven track record in the healthcare settings for which they are intended .
0  Jurisdictional practices may also vary and a common standard of trust in support of interoperability may require minimum standards for EHRi user authentication .
0  As well  the interactions between local authentication performed by POS applications and the EHRi (and its requirements for authenticated user access to support audit logging) have yet to be architected and the wide variety of POS applications currently in use will make this a challenging task .
0  Authorization of EHRi users is made difficult by the sometimes fluid nature of healthcare provisioning .
0  As EHRs become increasingly interoperable and the number of EHR users grows  so to does the risk of inappropriate access .
0  Whenever a request to retrieve a patient or persons EHR is initiated from a jurisdiction where a patient or person has not received care in the past  some additional authorization mechanisms may need to be invoked .
0  Finally  the EHRi will rely to a great extent on the functional information provided by the local POS application about the function that the user is attempting to perform (or the system the user is attempting to access) .
0  The specifics of this issue is not addressed by any of the requirements  although Privacy Requirement 8  Privacy Requirement 9  Privacy Requirement 10  Privacy Requirement 11  and Privacy Requirement 12 specify that consent data be captured by POS systems and transmitted to the EHRi when transmitting the underlying PHI .
0  Maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of data in transit is essential for maintaining privacy and security .
0  Encryption technology is now routinely applied to network traffic to protect its passage across networks such as the Internet86  The enduring confidentiality of PHI and the low cost of storing huge volumes of intercepted network traffic combine to place stringent demands on the cryptographic protection of PHI during transmission .
0  Maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of data in storage  backup and archive is made more difficult by the still infrequent use of encryption to protect PHI in storage  and by the difficulty of providing effective physical security for the servers in smaller clinics and physician offices that host POS applications .
0  An interoperable EHRi requires mechanisms for conferring access to a patient or persons EHR from one healthcare provider to another (e .g .\: from a primary care provider to a specialist to whom the patient or person is being referred) .
0  The proper architecting of such mechanisms  the policies for their use  and the auditing of their use are all essential for the maintenance of privacy and security .
0  To the extent that the EHRi allows the delivery of e-prescriptions from prescribing healthcare providers (e .g .\: physicians) to dispensing healthcare provider (e .g .\: pharmacists) there will be a need for the EHRi to support digital signatures .
0  This in turn will require  on a technical level  the recognition of valid Certification Authorities and the capacity to check for certificate revocation .
0  It will also require consistent policies and procedures for issuing digital certificates that meet the high standards of digital certificate issuance demanded of e-prescribing .
1  In addition to the liability implications if an alert is not properly delivered  there may be privacy implications and security implications if alerts are misrouted to other healthcare providers or are forwarded to other healthcare providers against the patient consent directives or persons consent directives .
1  It is important to note that laws provide for custodians to override consent directives .
1  The architecting of the alerts function must be carefully constructed to preserve the privacy of patient or persons .
0  The right of patients or persons to be notified of inappropriate access  use or disclosure should it occur is addressed in Privacy Requirement 20 .
1  The requirements do not address the issue of facilitating unmediated access to EHR data but the right to (mediated) access is confirmed by Privacy Requirement 24 .
0  Some jurisdictions also allow patients or persons to challenge the accuracy possibly and possibly completeness of their personal health information .
0  If patients or persons are provided with access to their EHR  even in a limited or mediated fashion  the EHRi may need to include a mechanism to facilitate conformance with this legal requirement  as well as ensure organisations respond to such requests within the legally permitted amount of time .
0  Although many healthcare providers are regulated healthcare professionals whose credentials can be obtained from regulatory colleges  other actors such as medical receptionists draw their authority to retrieve or update portions of the EHR (demographic information for example) from a healthcare custodian (for example  a physician in a solo practice who has employed the receptionist) .
0  Maintaining this chain of authority back to a regulated healthcare professional or officially recognized custodian is an important component of ensuring accountability for personal health information .
0  Such maintenance in turn may involve primary care providers and others in the EHR user registration process and hence may add considerable complexity to the simpler model of relying on provider registries drawn from the licensed credentials of the jurisdictional regulatory colleges .
0  This issue is addressed by Security Requirement 54 which specifies that user registration practices effectively maintain the chain of authority discussed above .
0  Responsibilities must be carefully delineated so that the entire EHRi remains continuously defended against intrusion .
0  Even routine (i .e .  non-real-time critical) logging of events merits routine  scheduled review and analysis and this too raises issues around responsibility for episodic audit of inter-jurisdictional information flows on a regular and timely basis .
1  Differing Models of Consent Consent requirements vary between provinces and the EHRi must accommodate all these jurisdictional consent models .
1  Some uses or disclosures in one province may require express consent  while in another they require implied consent94 .
1  Depending on a patient or persons location  legislation may require express  implied  or no consent for a particular collection  use  or disclosure of PHI .
1  An EHR architecture that is usable in more than one jurisdiction must be able to accommodate different consent models among jurisdictions  as well as provide interoperability among these differing models .
1  The issues surrounding consent are addressed in the following requirements\: Locking and Masking The EHRi  and the systems connected to it  will need to be designed in such a manner that a patient or person can lock or mask specific elements of PHI so as to prevent access and disclosure .
1  Consent directives can be overridden by authorized users in specific situations .
1  All such overrides must be logged and alerts should be created and sent to individuals responsible for that individuals privacy oversight (e .g . a CPO) .96 Patients or persons will need to be able to view all such overrides of their consent directives and the reasons for such overrides .
1  Healthcare providers (both individuals and organisations) will be responsible for informing patients or persons of the potential implications of their consent decisions .
1  But would it be reasonable  for example  for an ADT clerk to lock or mask a patient or persons mental health history or HIV status from future access or disclosure?
1  The issues surrounding consent are addressed in the following requirements\: Granting Consent An ability to Grant Consent would need to be included in the consent management functions (along with Withhold Consent and Revoke Consent) to allow for the documentation of express consent  where required .
1  The issues surrounding consent are addressed in the following requirements\: Presumption of Implied Consent In jurisdictions where implied consent is required for collection  use or disclosure of PHI  it will be presumed that organisations will fulfill the requirements for implied consent (either knowledgeable or informed e .g . informing patients of their rights) prior to EHRi users accessing  modifying or storing PHI via the EHRi .
1  The default value for the type of consent gathered will vary by jurisdiction and EHRi consent management functions will need to take these variations into account .
0  If they are not carefully architected  such registries could become tempting targets for hackers; acting in effect as a list of which patients or persons might have or where to find the most confidential PHI .
0  User authentication schemes (and other security mechanisms that users are exposed to) must not become a barrier to deployment and use .
1  Supporting the Custodial Responsibilities of Healthcare Providers Privacy stewardship issues and data stewardship issues will be barriers to adoption of EHR solutions if such solutions do not support custodial responsibilities of healthcare providers to protect the privacy of patients or persons and maintain the confidentiality of their data .
0  Individuals in jurisdictions that legally mandate that patients or persons have the legal right to comprehensively block or mask their data can use this ability to suppress access to their EHR prior to seeking a second opinion .
0  Setting demographics myoscar username should check it exists OSCAR Change Request v1 .2 .
0  One the demographics master file screen  when a myoscar username is set or changed  it should verify it exists before allowing it to save .
0  This should probably happen for when the provider sets their username too .
0  Just add a username that doesnt exist and see if it errors or allows it or notifys the user .
0  If a patients master file has notes or alerts present  it would be very useful to be able to see those on the Schedule Screen .
0  Make sure the links show up  and the data is in the titles .
0  Make sure the link is generated properly  and new window opens .
0  Autocomplete provider list when searching inbox .
0  Instead of having an unwieldy list of provider names when searching for labs in the inbox  provide an auto-completion list of names as the user types .
0  Comb through all JPA entities in OSCAR  determine which are PHI  fix any incomformances  etc .
0  I think most entities that are PHI would have no issue fulfilling contract we are proposing .
0  Currently there is no reasonable way to determine what data in the system is PHI .
0  A Pipeline of checks to see if the data should be delivered to the data requestor . . .this change is necessary for that .
0  There is no implementation of this concept in the Integrator software  so it is impossible for OSCAR to conform to various requirements (for example  2 .1 .1(a) requires a feature that allows a remote clinic to update the home clinics demographic information) .
0  The EMR Specification v4 .0 (https\://www .ontariomd .ca/portal/server .pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_3876_0_0_18/EMR_Specification_v40_Appendix%20A_Final_Jan172011 .pdf) clarifying requirements 2 .5 .1(b)  2 .5 .1(c) and 2 .5 .2(all) require that the data that was recorded on a remote system become available on the home clinic within 30 minutes .
0  CaisiIntegratorUpdateTask pushes all demographics if 'conformance test only features' are enabled .
0  StoreDocumentInDatabase in AddEditDocumentAction .addDocument() is called if 'conformance test only features' are enabled .
0  Integrator push task takes too long  fails to scale well .
0  Because of the design of both the Integrator and the Integrator push task in OSCAR  there is a lack of ability for the server to scale and support a large database of demographic data well .
0  For example\: For every type of data for every demographic to send  a separate web services call is made to the Integrator server (in the case of documents  there is a separate web services call for EVERY document) - there is significant overhead for every individual connection  even for small amounts of data .
0  For example\: The Integrator servers EventLog database table is written to far too frequently .
0  For a system that has a large number of simultaneous OSCAR connections  this table can grow in size at a measure of several gigabytes per day .
0  For example\: If there is an exception thrown during the Integrator push task for certain types of data  the entire push task is cancelled due to lack of appropriate exception handling .
0  For example\: There are issues where the list of demographics to send is always returned as the entire list of demographics admitted to the default facility - patients admitted to a facility other than the facility that is available in LoggedInInfo .currentFacility are never sent .
0  We need to create a full-functioning inventory management module that would include the following features\: Need to be able to track  enter  remove and transfer all inventory items (medications  medical supplies  etc) to and from a central location to outer clinics and back .
0  Run reports on the inventory status at each location as well as to report on a history of sales and transfers for each location .
0  We would like to create an electronic inventory ordering system within Oscar that can request and fill items for each location and automatically adjust the inventory amounts in the systems for each location .
0  We need to link the prescriptions in the in-house dispensing section to the inventory module so that when medications are dispensed in-house then the related inventory item will also deplete from the clinics  on-site inventory for that same amount and same product .
0  When OSCAR is implemented in our clinics  we will have to track inventory manually which is not a practice that can be sustained and will not have any abilities for reporting the necessary and mandatory information for transfers and stock levels which could result in lost revenue from items expiring before use .
0  Would we be able to have the default billing template view as showing dependent on the user logged in and filling it in at the time?
0  Physicians would open billing section and their default view would be the physician OHIP codes and when the nurse opens the billing section it would be defaulted to their specific billing sheet .
0  Currently all completed tests showing in the Preventions area show as light grey regardless is the result was normal or abnormal .
0  We need to be able to see At-A-Glance if the result was normal or abnormal by colour-coding these results differently (ie .
0  It is very important for staff to see a history of test results at-a-glance instead of having to open each item to determine the results .
0  We would like to customize the Preventions section to only show the items that are specific to related Program (i .e . Sexual Health testing and immunization options) .
0  We would also like to have an easy way to add or remove items from this list we would prefer that we could access this through the Administration area instead of this being a programming only item .
0  Incorrect options could be chosen as some items closely reflect others and are worded differently than how we phrase items in our clinics .
0  Need to have the functionality to auto-populate items from E-Forms directly to the Preventions Section (the same way that E-Forms can auto-populate to Measurements) .
0  This will entail that when certain specimens are obtained from the client in-house for lab processing that these details when checked on the e-form will then automatically create the new prevention item in the preventions section without the staff having to physically open this section and add a new prevention themselves .
0  We are trying to minimize time spent charting and with clients due to staff having to enter duplicate information in numerous areas of the client chart .
0  With the move from paper records to full electronic records we will need to have a way to track which paper charts have been archived to cold storage and what date this was done .
0  Paper charts will be archived after the clients  first visit to the clinics once OSCAR has been implemented or after 2 years of inactivity (whichever comes first) .
0  Which clinic location it was archived from .
0  The assigned paper chart ID # (to be entered manually by staff) .
0  Last Visit Date (to be entered manually be staff) and .
0  Date of archive (to be entered manually by staff maybe have a calendar option in this field?) .
0  We are required to be able to track specific information for archived or cold storage charts as they are stored off-site and may need to be retrieved in the future .
0  The above report creation will allow us to obtain the required information for this process which can involve the archiving of thousands of paper charts in a year .
0  Need to have the functionality to auto-populate items from E-Forms directly to the Prescriptions Section (the same way that E-Forms can auto-populate to Measurements) .
0  This will entail that when certain medications are dispensed to the client in-house that these details when checked on the e-form will then automatically create the new prescription in the prescriptions section without the staff having to physically open this section and add a new prescription themselves .
0  The appointment history page does not show (a) appointment status  (b) appointment type or (b) deleted appointments .
0  Client requires more information about previous and deleted appts without making custom reports .
0  Allow the management of extra items in the relationship type through the use of a db table .
0  MyOscar generates username for Oscar registration .
0  An enhancement to the account generation procedure for Oscar-to-MyOscar registration .
0  Problem\: Currently  Oscar generates usernames based on a simple firstname +  .
0  A Patient whose name is Bob Smith would be automatically generated a username of bob .smith   and the user has the ability to submit with this username or choose another .
0  Both the username generated by the system and any username chosen by the user can be non-unique and thus rejected by MyOscar s validation .
0  Upon entry to the Register For MyOscar screen\: System generates a username per the existing logic .
0  Upon entry to the Register For MyOscar screen\: System passes generated username  first name and last name to new MyOscar Web Service ( to validate that this username is valid .
0  Upon entry to the Register For MyOscar screen\: *New* MyOscar username pre-validation web service .
0  Register For MyOscar screen displays with the username returned from MyOscar .
0  Optionally\: instead of returning a single username  MyOscar returns a list of valid usernames for the user to choose from based on the user s first-name .
0  The Oscar screen would display the list and allow the user to choose .
0  This screen is accessible from both the Edit Patient Detail screen  and the Encounter screen  when the Patient is not currently registered for MyOscar .
0  Use generated  unique MyOscar ID + generated password .
0  Oscar user has valid MyOscar credentials .
0  Search in MyOscar finds user .
0  User-specified  unique MyOscar ID + user-specified password .
0  Result\: Displays red error message next to username field indicating that MyOscar registration was rejected due to non-unique username .
0  Search in MyOscar does not find user .
0  Conditions\: Username unique .
0  Oscar user has invalid MyOscar credentials .
0  Result\: Displays red error message at top of screen indicating that Oscar user doesn t have valid MyOscar credentials .
0  Search in MyOscar does not find the new user .
0  Result\: Displays red error message at top of screen indicating that MyOscar is down .
0  Bring MyOscar up  and user search does not find the new user .
0  Other exceptions\: Conditions\: Username unique  all fields valid .
0  Result\: System displays orange warning message at top of screen indicating that the user was generated but there was a problem generating the  .
0  User search in MyOscar finds the new user .
0  When creating a new appointment in the OSCAR screen the location field is open text .
0  Wed like it to be a drop down field with with preset locations .
0  Without the option to override the text and default to the currently selected clinic .
0  (This will only be seen if CAISI is enabled and you are in the OSCAR view) .
0  Hamilton Public Health will not be able to pull accurate reports on where the client were seen at .
0  Including a feature from the master demographic screen in order to see history of addresses and phone numbers for the patient .
1  Client may have specifically instructed that phone is not an option and these types of comments are very important in following PHIPA for privacy and consent .
0  Having a drop down menu available for the reason for visit with an other option that could be available if the reason isnt available in the drop down .
0  If staff have the ability to write their own text in box then this will result in unlimited options for the reasons for visit that will make statistical collection and reporting more difficult to collate on our end .
1  If the client is from the US having ability to set options\: U .S . Resident Consent Form Signed By Client .
1  If the client is from the US having ability to set options\: U .S . Resident Consent Form NOT Signed By Client .
1  If the client is from the US having ability to set options\: A checkbox stating that we have privacy consent in order to take down the clients information on the master demographic intake screen .
0  If the client is from the US having ability to set options\: If its the clients first visit and they havent checked the informed consent .
1  A pop-up reminder comes up onload of the echart  informing staff they need to review informed consent with client before any services are rendered .
1  Ideally  staff being able to confirm they have consent through the pop-up which will automatically update the checkbox in the master demographic screen .
1  Hamilton Public Health needs to document if the client is a U .S . Resident and that the consent has been signed for legal purposes .
1  Hamilton Public Health has to follow PHIPA which indicates that we have 'privacy' consent and 'informed' consent before rendering any services to the client .
0  Staff may not notice which clinic location they have selected and may end up booking clients at the wrong clinic location .
0  Ability to bill for multiple disciplines .
0  Need the ability to bill for multiple disciplines .
0  Create the ability for OSCAR to bill multiple disciplines such as physiotherapy  chiropractors .
0  User will not be able to split  rotate  remove pages or replace a document once its assigned to a patient .
0  If the document is to be modified (split pages  remove pages . . .) or replaced  the original document should be marked as deleted and a new document added .
0  This can be done through refile a document .
0  Note\: The document can still be modified (split  remove  rotate pages) if it is not yet assigned to a patient .
0  User can split  rotate  remove pages or replace the document in the patient file .
0  Right now  a document attached to a patient can be modified and replaced by uploading a new file via editdocument .jsp .
0  Also  pages can be removed via split pages or delete first page .
0  Set the provider  visit type  etc for the default values .
0  Users will need to be taught how to use the admin interface for the billing defaults .
0  Users will need to understand how the 'cascading' and defaulting works .
0  When a document is placed in a wrong patient file  an user can select the queue and click the refile button .
0  The document will be copied from the DOCUMENT_DIR to the INCOMINGDOCUMENT_DIR in the selected queue .
0  The original document will be marked as deleted .
0  The lot numbers would be prepopulated by an Admin account ahead of a vaccination clinic  for example  and stored in a new table .
0  There would also be a delete option .
0  Therefore  if the table  does not exist or is empty for that immunization  no combo-box would be displayed .
0  When an action is successfully completed  create the right ApplicationEvent and register the event .
0  Store provider_no and billing dates in session when creating a hospital bill  and use them as the default for the next hospital bill .
0  Open the hospital billing page and make sure visit type and visit location are set properly .
0  CDM indicators create an encounter note every time a section gets updates .
0  For permanent removal of notes\: Ensure that measurements are still saved properly on update .
0  Ensure that no notes are created on update .
0  For property setting\: Ensure that the default (no property set) behavior matches the current system .
0  Ensure that setting the property disables note creation .
0  PMM\: referral allow access to CME if client referred to you .
0  Request creation of tags for the following fields from the patient master demographic .
0  Request creation of tags for the following fields from the Provider Record .
0  Make default_view definable by user .
0  Column on msg listing show if message is linked to a patient .
0  Separate column on the messaging list to show if the message is linked to a patient .
0  Have a Print option for a Flowsheet .
0  It would be excellent to have several of OSCARs tools on a single page for a doctor who is working .
0  So a place in oscar where you can set the symbols for the whole clinic and then in the prefs the ability for the user to override with their own symbols .
0  It would be nice if you could put files in folders or groups in the e section instead of one big list .
0  No Verify i if the prov doesn t have a bill # .
0  Dont show the Verify i if the provider does not have an OHIP or billing no .
0  Similar to the Billing option where a resident must select a supervisor .
0  Document listing would show documents clicked .
0  Forms would not let you close the window warning .
0  Windows would not let you close the window without asking you if you wanted to save the changes .
0  Printing mulitple documents from patient record .
0  Need an easy way to print all the documents in a patient record .
0  View of Template when scheduling .
0  From Schedule template setting screen be able to see a view of the template .
0  Ie a view of what that template looks like .
0  When selecting an issue for the first time  provider is forced to select if it is certain or not .
0  In current list section in R column - only unresolved issues are shown  with an option to show resolved issues .
0  In the display current issues list\: only show current issues  have resolved issues in black - give instructions next to current issues reference stating that blue issues are unresolved  black issues are resolved .
0  Have a link to show or hide unresolved issues .
0  Unify current issues with ongoing concerns .
0  Ability to 'tag' messages .
0  Would be nice to have a common set of tags that would be shared with edocs .
0  Devel  log on as oscar .
0  Note that a new tickler does not have the current client as the default demographic .
0  When you click on + for tickler  then the current client appears as the default demographic .
0  Ability to copy public message to private section .
0  Restrict who can delete documents .
0  Restrict who can delete documents to the users that uploaded the document or a user with the document deleting privilege .
0  For example\: Log on to devel .caisi .ca .
0  For example\: click on a clients name .
0  For example\: click on Manage Health Number Registry .
0  For example\: When you click 'validate' under the tombstone data a pop up window should .
0  Overview\: user should be able to take a head of the family  e .g . father with two dependents and admit the father into a program (admit to a room will be a separate feature but also required for this RFQ demo but needs a bit of work from Louis) .
0  When the father is admitted to the program all the dependents follow the father and get admitted into the same program .
0  Requirements\: find summary page of head of family with e .g . 2 dependents .
0  Requirements\: click on refer tab .
0  Requirements\: find a program (e .g . Birkdale) that the head is not currently in .
0  Requirements\: click on process referral .
0  Requirements\: click on home in navigator .
0  Requirements\: click on birkdale link .
0  Requirements\: click on queue tab .
0  Requirement\: the head along with the two dependents is now in the queue  with the head at top of list followed by the two dependents (make sure they follow so that we know who belongs to who) . . .if one of the dependents is already in the program being referred to  then that dependent is not in the queue .
0  Requirement\: add a column (or some flag) that defines the head as the head and the dependents as dependents .
0  We have for saving CME notes .
0  Ability to save a UCF that is saved temporarily but not signed .
0  The saved UCF has all the features of a signed and saved UCF  however it .
0  Is replaced when the UCF is signed .
0  When the current 'save' button is clicked and the 'signed' box is unchecked  then the UCF is saved in the current usual way  if this UCF has already been saved  then the previous one is replaced .
0  If the 'save' button is clicked and the 'signed' box is checked  then the UCF is saved and if this UCF has already been saved  then the previous one is replaced .
0  If the status is 'signed' then if the user clicks on update  then the form is opened as it is currently saved  ie with current values etc . and this is like a new instance of this form  ie as above the form can be saved or signed and saved etc .
0  Once a form is signed and saved  it cannot be 'editted'  it can only be updated and saved as another instance  hence in this case signing it commits the user to that saved instance of the form . . . .if it is unsigned then anyone can update it and change the values and sign and save it . . . .in the future we might in a similar way to the CME have it set up so that it can be editted by the user who saved it (rather than update it)  however this may require more time and can be worked around as above .
0  What genders they will admit  what age range they will admit and the length of time for a service restriction .
0  Requirement\: click on edit next to one of the facilities (e .g . Seaton House) .
0  Note that bozo_clown has access to merging duplicate client records .
0  As discussed  the set is defined as anyone who has ever been in the programs in your program domain in which your role has allow duplicate client merge permission .
0  We should discuss where to put a service restriction interface for a client . . . .I dont know what makes the most sense in terms of ease of programming . . . .one thought that makes sense but may be a lot of UI work is in the PMM client page put a tab called service restriction another would be just a button on the client summary page in pmm .
0  Have a drop down menu for facilities in that users facility domain .
0  Have a drop down menu for programs that are in the users program domain AND in the selected facility default is any program .
0  You must select either a facility or a program within such a facility to process the restriction  .
0  When you click on save .
0  System checks if the length of the service restriction is less than the limit for that program (if a limit exists for the program  it overrides the facility limit) or facility (if there is no program limit) .
0  The service restriction you are making exceeds that allowed by your facility or program .
0  System saves date range of the service restriction  the comment  the date and time stamp the restriction was made and the signature of the person who made the restriction .
0  Tomislav  right now service restrictions that are not in effect are not shown . . . expired service restrictions do not show up .
0  Requirements\: hide the following columns .
0  Referring provider  completion notes  status  notes .
0  Requirements\: add the following two columns .
0  Requirements\: Referring program or agency .
0  Requirements\: this is the program that the client was referred from .
0  This can take be of two different types\: Internal\: In our example above  the referring program or agency = Birkdale Shelter Program .
0  This can take be of two different types\: external\: this occurs when a new or old client is admitted using the registration intake .
0  This can take be of two different types\: this is equal to 'no' if the referring program or agency is internal and 'yes' if the referring program or agency is external as above in ii) .
0  E-form preview window should be larger by default .
0  Most e-forms will be designed to be printed on letter-sized paper  having a width of 750px .
0  I suppose no one in his right mind is doing e-form stuff on an i-phone sized display  so having a default larger size for this window shouldnt hinder many people .
0  Mark on the page the original print date .
0  Make appointment screen colour coded dependent on RS .
0  Would like to add the ability to change the background colour of the make a screen  based on the demographics roster status .
0  One way to do it would be to check for a corresponding roster colour key in the property table .
0  Eg roster status\: FS would have the key FS_COLOUR  If the key is found in the property table use the value as the colour  if not default to regular colour .
0  On the schedule page  it would be nice to have a button that takes me to my schedule for today in one click  similar for what was done for the ticklers .
0  We should be able to block days and times off in our schedules as either here or not here .
0  This would be very useful for us and for staff booking clients with us  to avoid clients being booked on days Im not here  . . . I never see these appointments .
0  It also allows everyone to know which providers are here when  which may help with program planning .
0  Ability to hide warnings .
0  Should be warning specific and invalidate when a warning has changed .
0  Ability to share Rx Favourites .
0  In the detailed view of the a  show when the a was originally created .
0  PMM\: queue missing reject button .
0  Note that in remote queue  there is no reject button .
0  There should be a reject button that behaves in the same way as the local reject button  ie leads to same next screens .
0  RFQ Feature\: Agency  shelter  program real time occupancy .
0  As discussed in email . . .we want real time occupancy or bed capacity for the City  shelters and programs .
0  Bed Capacities\: the bed capacity for a program is the sum of all the room capacities that are associated for that program .
0  Bed Capacities\: the bed capacity for a facility is the sum of all the room capacities that are associated with that facility .
0  Bed Capacities\: the bed capacity for the Agency (who SMIS system) is the sum of the bed capacities for all the facilities for the system .
0  The bed occupancies\: the bed occupancy for a program is the number of clients admitted to a bed program .
0  The bed occupancies\: the bed occupancy for a facility is the total number of clients admitted to programs that belong to that facility (this assumes that programs DO NOT span multiple facilities - administrators must respect this rule  otherwise this number will be inaccurate - for this release we will use this assumption) .
0  The bed occupancies\: the bed occupancy for the agency (whole system) is the total number of clients admitted to all the programs in the agency .
0  This form has a new field to specific if FOBT tests are for the new ColonCancerCheck program .
0  Do a Save As in your browser when looking at the monthly appointment status flip view .
0  It is a bulky 560KB large (even without any appointments present) .
0  Support to billg Year Preventive Care Bonus codes for FHG or FHN or FHO or FHT etc - service codes Q100A to Q121A .
0  These codes must be submitted to MOH with a blank Health Number  blank Version Code  and blank Date of Birth .
0  I have been unable to find a location with OSCAR to create and submit this billings .
0  It also appears that I cannot create a 'dummy' patient with those above values as blank .
0  It appears that the database schema will allow these values to be blank  but the OSCAR user interface would not .
0  We received a Java null error when searching for the patient .
0  There is a need for doctors to review and verify a residents billing .
0  Right now the only way to verify is for a doctor to rebill the visit .
0  Enhance selected tests on Lab Reqs .
0  We have had a couple of calls from different technicians at LifeLabs comment about the Lab Req from OSCAR (LabReq07) .
0  They find that some information is hard to see at a quick scan such as the Therapeutic Drug Monitoring or the information in the Other Tests section .
0  They have called our office to find out why we had submitted extra vials of blood only to be corrected on the information in the lab req .
0  Also  in other instances  the nurse taking the blood has mentioned that she has to double check the lab req because it is easy to miss a selected test .
0  I think I have found a way to change the lab req to bold the entered values in text field by changing the BaseFont .HELVETICA to BaseFont .HELVETICA_BOLD (I need to test this still) .
0  Is it possible to have color or other forms of highlighting or enhancement to have these selected values stand out on the print lab req?
0  Provider number needed in 2 admin areas .
0  Right now when you have three providers with the same name entered (e .g . if done by mistake or other reasons) it's not possible to distinguish the providers in 2 important places\: in the security log  the drop down where you select the provider you can't tell which provider you are selecting (this is important e .g . if you want to figure out which provider number is being used actively versuswhich one is incorrect needs to be inactivated) .
0  Right now when you have three providers with the same name entered (e .g . if done by mistake or other reasons) it's not possible to distinguish the providers in 2 important places\: when you are assigning the security login in  the drop down where you select the provider just provides the names  and if the name is the same  you will have e .g . 2-3 of the same values and it won't be clear to the administrator which one is being used .
0  SLA Contracts to include status stats .
0  The following are statistics that will be collected\: totals of clients in the system .
0  The following are statistics that will be collected\: totals related to use of the system (e .g . total number of encounters  total immunization entries) .
0  The following are statistics that will be collected\: totals related to subgroups of clients (e .g . chronically homeless clients) .
0  Create a new tab to the right of facilities tab called login .
0  Have two drop down fields for this screen\: program drop down .
0  Have two drop down fields for this screen\: default login page drop down .
0  Have two drop down fields for this screen\: the program drop down only lists the programs that this user is assigned to or a blank .
0  Have two drop down fields for this screen\: if a program is selected the default login page drop down lists two pages .
0  Program management home .
0  Integrate CIHI change request to export .
0  Integrate current CIHI requirements to export demographic .
0  Check that data is captured in xml files according to CIHI specs .
0  Currently the OSCAR encounter view has a view of notes with a small arrow that hides or reveals the note .
0  When hidden the first line shows so that it is like a summary view of this note .
0  If you want to see the details of notes you have to open them one by one .
0  It would be helpful (as in the CAISI CME) to be able to set all the notes to detailed or summary view so that you can scroll through the notes without having to open and close them and so that you can search through the notes with the browser find functions .
0  Currently one is forced to record the observation date in a record  which is an extra step .
0  In most (almost all) cases the observation date is the current date  please make the observation date default to the current date .
0  Currently when you click on details of a previously collected consent there is no indication of who collected the consent .
0  Consent obtained by' ' on .
0  Photo\: the photo should not be empty .
0  Name\: none of the fields in this section should be blank .
0  Name\: HN cannot be blank (I will have a separate feature request for reducing duplicate and erroneous HNs) .
0  Name\: type should be one of the values in the drop down in OSCAR .
0  When clicking on document in eChart  the user currently receives the actual file .
0  When clicking on a document  a document viewer window should pop up .
0  The window will have three columns\: left column will display a list of patient documents and links to view  middle will display a facsimile of the document which by clicking on it will download the file to the users computer  right column will display comment history of the document .
0  Along the top of the window will be navigation links to iterate forward and backward in the list .
0  All updates to preventions  allergies  drugs  measurements tables write to updateDate field .
0  Benefits\: Allows follow-up to patients re\:consult without searching for patient email elsewhere .
0  Search for patient  opening master demographic) .
0  Create new consult request .
0  Open existing consult request\: Ensure patient email populates on Consultation Request Form .
0  Open existing consult request\: Ensure patient email populates on Printable Consultation Request .
0  History of creators or editors of transaction in view  add provider to the transaction history ( edit invoice bottom right) .
0  Role based access\: access by issue (object) type .
0  Currently  if someone has access to the CME  regardless of their role  they can view all documents in the Document Management System .
0  We have an expressed request from an agency to enable a system whereby there can be role-based access to documents  similar to case notes .
0  Perhaps this could utilize the same format as was created for UCFs  whereby each document (if someone did not want open access) would have to be added as an OSCAR object and defined for each role .
0  Understandably  documents can contain very sensitive information  which should not be viewed by all parties .
1  I spoke with Tomislav about the issue surrounding clients opposing the taking of their photo which will obviously prevent clients having a record copied to the HNR .
1  We were thinking it might be helpful to add a small checkbox in the photo field of local data  to the effect of 'Client declined to have photo taken' so we can consistently track if this is the problem for that individual not having an HNR record .
0  My understanding is that clients should now be automatically linked through their health number .
0  Bill more than one service code and dx on a page .
0  Enable functionality to bill more than one service code and diagnostic on a billing page .
0  This would be difficult with the current interface because the first dx code is linked with all biling codes and we would need a way to have a different dx code for each billing code .
0  Current consult form only has ongoing concerns listed  not current issues . . . .incorporate current issues into this . . .
0  Create Statement for billing items .
0  Instead of individual receipt printing have ability to print a statement .
0  Keep default information between bills .
0  Clicking on $ on daysheet brings to invoice list of patient .
0  Batch update in invoice list .
0  Ability to check a list of rejected items and reprocess and resubmit .
0  And example physician not up on the list at teleplan as having registered the assignment of payment so all the claims are rejected .
0  Once teleplan has that physician listed it would be great to be able to click on all the rejected claims and with one click  resubmit them all .
0  Enable this in all rejection types including PWE .
0  Note that visit location is default set for \'St . Joseph\'s Hospital .
0  Note that the referral date is given  it would be useful to have the number of days in queue in addition to referral date as this is easier to process in terms of queue management and prioritizing clients to admit .
0  In pmm click on intake editor form .
0  Note it is not possible to determine which of the intake registration intakes in the list of intake forms (registration intake 1 - registration intake 11) is published .
0  Date intake form published by .
0  Users should be able to have the option of choosing what sex and HCType should appear by default when adding a new demographic .
0  The default value of HCType should also be used to determine the default value of Province .
0  Integration of Referral\: useabilityof admit or reject process .
0  Currently  if a remote facility has made a referral to your program  in your program queue  an admit and reject button appear .
0  The client who was referred is a real client belonging to another facility (so there is no need to show remote clients in the search - would make more sense to automatically start a new client linked to the remote client in the referral) .
0  The client may exist in the current facility (in which case you would want to potentially link the remote client being referred to this local client) .
0  So as a next release we have these requirements\: link the admission or rejection to a client already in the local instance or .
0  So as a next release we have these requirements\: create a new record in the local instance that is linked to the remote instance client that was referred .
0  Requirements part I\: in pmm history tab for any client  change referral history table from the following columns .
0  Program name | program type | referral date | completion date | referring program or agency | external to program or facility | program type | referral date | completion date | referring provider or agency | status .
0  Status has values\: 'current' (this is only true when completion date is null) .
0  Scenario\: Client CA from Facility FA is referred to program PB in facility FB which is a bed or service program .
0  A\: link admit or reject to client already in local instance .
0  Status has values\: note that client CA from facility FA is in the queue .
0  Status has values\: non null result of new client search of local instance is presented (same as new client search but hide all remote results) .
0  Status has values\: when you select client CB0 from the local instance  the remote client CA in facility FB is linked to the local client CB0 .
0  Status has values\: after the selection you are thrown into the client summary screen .
0  Status has values\: if you selected admit  then in current programs you see that the client has been automatically admitted to program PB) .
0  B\: note that client CA from facility FA is in the queue .
0  B\: non null result of new client search of local instance is presented (same as new client search but hide all remote results) .
0  B\: you look at non-null result and non of the results in the local instance are a match .
0  B\: you click on new client .
0  B\: you are thrown into the client summary screen of a new client who has all of client CA information from FA copied .
0  B\: if you selected admit  then in current programs you see that the client has been automatically admitted to program PB) .
