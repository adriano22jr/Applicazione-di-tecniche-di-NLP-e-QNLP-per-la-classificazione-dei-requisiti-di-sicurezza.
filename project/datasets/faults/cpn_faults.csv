PRE EDIT:
    req7        The CNG should detect replayed user and/or device credentials .
    req8        When the CNG detects replayed user and/or device credentials, the CNG shall stop the relevant processes .
    req31/143   The CNG and the CPN shall be able to support parental control related functionalities limiting the use of the broadband connection on a user or time basis. Limitations on a content basis may be shared with devoted network servers .
    req32/144   The CNG shall be equipped with a WAN interface towards the NGN, implementing layer 1 and 2 functionalities ("one-box" solution) .
    req36/148   The CNG shall support different IP address schemes and subnets on the same physical LAN port, and on different LAN ports, irrespective of routed or bridged mode of operation, allowing the direct addressability of CNDs from the NGN side in relation to data plane, control plane and management plane flows .
    req41/153   The CNG and the Customer Network shall assure the confidentiality, the integrity of signalling/control/media and management flows .
    req42/154   The CNG and the Customer Network shall provide the opportunity for a customer network administrator to perform service and network-related configuration. According to the service/network provider choices, the CNG and Customer Network may prevent - user initiated modification of network and service related parameters .
    req67/172   The CNG shall support mechanisms for managing IPTV flows provided both in unicast and multicast mode .
    req74/179   STB or media gateways should be equipped with a programmable open API allowing the implementation of specific service logics .
    req85       The CNG and the CPN shall support adequate Quality of Service mechanisms (e.g. prioritize the traffic in the event that there is not sufficient bandwidth in the customer network in order to ensure the correct network performances to each traffic flow). To achieve this objective a number of functionalities shall be supported by CNG and/or CNDs, as defined in the following bullets. Most of the following set of requirements is defined adopting as a reference the Home Gateway Initiative (HGI) Release 1 Specification mentioned in clause 2 [6] .
    req125      In order to support the NGN services and intra-CPN communications, all the CNDs in the CPN shall be addressable directly or by the mean of the CNG using L2/L3 mechanisms .
    req199      In case of managed services, the CNG shall support zero-touch provisioning to activate new services, starting from Internet access to voice and video services and shall be remotely manageable. In case of unmanaged services the user shall be able to configure the CNG by himself .
