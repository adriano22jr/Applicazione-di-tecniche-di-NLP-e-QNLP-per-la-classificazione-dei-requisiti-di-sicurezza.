0  So we want to get a button running from the face sheet to the case management screen where the provider will be able to see the client list and click into Encounter files .
0  It is unclear as to where to save the new note you have written because the Save i disappears .
0  You can only sign save and exit .
0  Enable OSCAR CME UI .
0  Within the OSCAR CME UI  if you add a prescription using a link in the upper right hand corner of the screen  once you select 'update print and save' the CME window does not refresh with the prescription .
0  You have to get out of the CME  and re-enter for it to record the latest prescription .
0  Logged onto Newtonbrook .
0  Notice that there is a Tickler i for that document .
0  If you select the Tickler  it is the OSCAR tickler system  not CAISI . . .can this be changed?
0  We would like the blank in-take forms to be name-able from the beginning rather than having to save the form and then re-name it .
0  Basically wed like a drop down list that would sit beside or below the encounter type in the note writing section .
0  Agencies want to be able to log how much time a provider spent on the phone  face to face  or with other providers .
0  Produce a visual indication that multi-page printed hardcopy is complete for all printed reports .
1  Inform users of the confidential nature of personal health information by showing this labeling on any hardcopy printout displaying data .
0  Institutions or addresses .
0  Departments or programs (linked subset of the institutions) .
0  By linked subset I mean that institutions to department or program is one to many - it could perhaps be done the way it is currently done for specialists e .g . you could have a list of all of the departments and then for each facility or institution you could check off which departments belong to that facility - so when you select an institution the drop down for departments will be a particular subset of the total list of departments - this would make sense for hospitals where each hospital has e .g . a radiology  microbiology department etc .
0  Consent to contact\: yes or no (drop down) - this is linked to client and contact .
0  Status\: active or inactive (drop down) - this is linked to client and contact .

0  Shelter bed programs C .
0  Number of placements into housing (including D .
0  Friends  relatives  private or public housing .
0  Number of return admissions to shelter (total recidivism) E .
0  Number of return admissions from housing F .
0  Intakes should prepopulate from previous versions of the form .
0  Tomislav mentioned to me that there is already this feature for a hospitalization issue .
0  The report would be run based on a time frame (like all the reports  start date and end date) and would pull all the times that this issue was used  the master file number of the client .
0  To add to this report\: Can you make it a generic report on an issue - where the provider can choose the issue they want to run the report on .
0  To add to this report\: Can the report include the date  client name and provider name - for each time the issue was used in a set time frame .
0  Ability to respond to an eReferral with textual data as well as blob data  where the blob data is expected to be something like a for maybe an image of a scanned document .
0  This will allow any feature in oscar to send information to another oscar  as long as its tied to a client via the health number .
0  Ability to send eform to PHR .
0  We would like the ability to send eforms to MyOscar similar to the way we can currently send oscar documents to MyOscar .
0  The current though is to convert the eform into   then send the to myoscar .
0  A button to show how this med has been prescribed in the clinic before .
0  Fill in instruction and special instruction .
0  Return unique med history based on number of occurence .
0  Display med history .
0  PMM\: new client  bed program is mandatory .
0  I am not sure if this somehow conflict with face-to-face encounter  which I believe is an option some agencies use as it is based on some standardized reporting tool .
0  As previously discussed  there has been several requests to improve the concept of merging client records  specifically by allowing case notes to be copied from one file to another .
0  While merging client files allows the PMM files to be linked  there currently is nothing done to allow the actual case notes to transfer from the incorrect file to the main record  making this process slightly confusing to our end user .
0  Default Date should be added to case notes in OSCAR UI .
0  Notice that the case note at the bottom of the screen is ready for you to write  however  once completed  there is no default date . . .you must select the date  even if it is todays date .
0  Also  being that the CPP issues are displayed constantly at the top of the CME page  they should not each be given a separate listing similar to case notes as this could easily get very dense and require providers to scroll through a lot of information (a physician recommended this to us) .
0  Ticklerplus\: add creation date and assigned doctor to report .
0  OCAN XML export\: create file with list of clients exprted .
0  When you click on download report  somehow a file with a list of all the files in that xml report gets produced .
0  This file will contain the following info\: file name of the xml .
0  This file will contain the following info\: the following information for each client in that XML file (in columns) .
0  This will be a record for the agency staff of what was in the submission file .
0  Also include the unique ID for that client submission as a column in the xml submission summary . . .
0  Ability to Undelete deleted documents .
0  The ability to recover deleted documents .
0  The delete action should only appear to administrators or the user who uploaded the document .
0  The undelete action should only appear to administrators or the user who uploaded the document .
0  All users should be able to see and view deleted and active documents .
0  Mark Demographics for inclusion of newsletter .
0  Have a field in the demographics that lets you mark if a patient wants to be included in the newsletter .
0  RFQ Feature\: please add additional action access values .
0  Allow duplicate client merge .
0  RFQ Feature\: enforce or override service restriction .
0  When you click on save button in registration page the system should .
0  Check for programs in the list of programs and facilities that the client is restricted from which are active and see if the program being admitted into is one of these programs .
0  Check for the facilities in the list of programs and facilities that the client is restricted from which are active and see if the program being admitted into is a program that belongs to one of these facilities .
0  If a or b are true then produce the following message to the user .
0  The client currently has a service restriction in effect at the program or facility you are trying to admit the client into .
0  If a or b are true AND the user has a role in which they have Service restriction override on admission in their role for that program then produce the following message to the user .
0  You have permission to override this restriction .
0  Admit from Queue (in program queue page) .
0  When you click on admit button next to client name in the queue the system should .
0  Randy already has a page which allows you to turn on or off the new case management for individuals in real time .
0  Once you are logged in to OSCAR  you can access it .
0  RFQ Feature\: set up agency  facilities  program  room  beds .
0  It needs to be clear on the left hand side of the navigation what is administration (editing or modifying values  adding rooms  beds  etc .) and what is merely informative (seeing agency information  listing facilities  showing bed occupancy) .
0  We need to clarify what roles can do edit or update or create tasks versus listing tasks .
0  Can any SMIS user see the list of all facilities and their room occupancies?
0  The report that we need is described at the bottom  briefly this is a testing of the reporting feature by creating a report that we already have in CAISI\: a list of program admissions and discharges in a particular date range .
0  RFQ Feature\: link reg intake gender to list editor table .
0  Find client tomislav  test .
0  Note that there is a gender variable drop down there .
0  Requirement\: please link this gender drop down to the list generated in the CAISI List editor as per previous bug .
0  Upon duplicate name it gives an error (the error above was because you created 2 facilities with <blank> as the name) .
0  As per our discussion  we have a definite function for a 'facilities level' admin and that is to be able to send messages to all staff in a facility .
0  Here is a stab at the requirements\: log into devel as oscar .
0  Here is a stab at the requirements\: click on 'Facilities Messages' then click on 'Create New message' - the Facilities Message Editor should be the same as the 'System Message Editor' but it will have a drop down menu that will include the Facilities in the Facility domain of that user .
0  Here is a stab at the requirements\: when you click on save  that message will appear the same way as it does for the system message however only for users who share that facility domain .
0  Here is a stab at the requirements\: because this is a separate object  we can create a 'Facility Admin' role and create role rights for this role in the usual OSCAR assign role rights to object function .
0  RFQ-SD2\: filter programs in program list .
0  This feature is about adding an ability to filter the program list by the facilities that the programs are associated with .
0  The drop down list contains all the facilities as well as the word any .
0  When the word 'any' is selected  then all the programs are displayed  when one facility e .g . Seaton House is listed  then you see all the programs associated with Seaton House in the table constructed by Ted .
0  Currently when a new user is set up in OSCAR  a provider number is assigned for the provider .
0  When 1500 providers are being managed this becomes difficult or impossible to manage .
0  Requirement\: change the provider number field from being a field that is filled out to one that is automatically generated .
0  Requirement\: incorporate a manner to not interfere with old provider numbers when this function is introduced to a database that already contains provider numbers . . . .e .g . the process identifies the highest provider number and then increments this by 1 for the next provider number .
0  RFQ-SD2\: remove caisi roles link in nav bar .
0  In CDS  please have the gender default to what is in the registration intake  namely male  female or transgender or other = other .
0  In the Encounter  under the tab 'Patient History' there are several areas where general information about the client can be entered in (family history  social history  medical history  etc .) .
0  According to the College of Physicians  it should be updated regularly and the last date the CPP is updated should be displayed .
0  It is recommended that doctors use this to keep the most current general picture of a clients overall health .
0  Is there anyway on the Patient History tab there can be a feature that says 'Updated Last\:' or something to that effect that would have the date that someone last entered information and saved it?
0  Ultimately it would be great to have that 'toggle' feature so the health care professionals can use the Oscar CME and the other users can use the CAISI CME - but for now I would say that having the date is a good immediate solution .
0  Point out new items and categories .
1  That is\: there are two versions of the consent form .
1  That is\: opt in version .
1  That is\: opt out version .
1  That is\: there is an exit survey after the consent is obtained . . .
0  There is an 'end date' in the Master file but if this is changed  it has no reflection in the above HNR field (and from what Tomislav said it is related to the expiry of the record as a whole) .
0  I believe the 'end date' on the master file represents when the client ceases to be come a patient  i .e . the corresponding 'date joined'  I do not believe this is the 'expiry date' of the HIN .
1  Can you please make a small change on the consent history in the forms tab (looks great by the way) . . . .
1  Consented to all .
1  No consent given etc .
1  So everytime the consent status is changed  it is tracked in these forms and then you can look at the wording of the form etc .
1  As per conversation  the display of the form should display the selected consent and the selected consent will not be on the listing summary .
0  Requirement\: please have Medication Records appear also as a view link between legal and old chart .
0  Activity Report - please put link in admin page .
0  Theres the activity report which allows program and date range input and outputs counts by role and encounter type  and groupings of issues  and this report is NOT hidden and is currently on the menu .
0  This assumes that all instances are using the same definitions and values for gender which is the case in the integrated community right now . . . .
0  You currently allow an agency to import tombstone data into the registration form from the integrator .
0  Ie the client should have a photo in the integrator that is treated in the same way that e .g . the DOB is treated .
0  This photo should have a limit in size e .g . 500kb .
1  The addition of the picture should be linked to an additional line added to the consent Include my picture as part of my identification between agencies\: Yes or no .
1  If 'no' then the picture from the local database is not sent to integrator .
0  As discussed please develop an export function that allows an intake questionnaire be exported and imported into another installation .
0  Allow us to build forms in the Registration Intake Editor that can be accessed by agencies in the Forms tab .
0  WL please create a new role .
0  This role has all the same access as WL operator role .
1  Who obrained the consent should be blocked out as well as the agency where the consent was obtained until we have granularity built into the consent process .
1  The next requirement (not in this feature unless easy to implement) will be to show the provider who obtained the consent if this information is also allowed by the type of consent given (e .g . if a client does not want it known that he was at a mental health clinic  then it should not be known that a psychiatrist obtained the consent) .
1  Actually show all aspects of the consent in the remote agency  as we add granularity we can remove information from the consent as required by consent granularity .
0  Need ability to find the creator of a bill in the Edit inv .
0  Need to be able to find the creator of a bill in the Edit invoice area .
0  For example\: When you click 'validate' under the tombstone data a pop up window should appear that says  .
0  Right now you need to re-prescribe a med to set it to long term .
0  During a med review it would be nice to be able to flag a med as long term without having to re-presribe .
0  As a consuming application  I want to store exam results using the Electronic Data Interchange Personal Identifier (EDIPI) as the patient identifier so the exam result is available for retrieval by EDIPI in the disability claims adjudication process .
0  The EDIPI is the primary patient identifier for the storage of exam results .
0  Exam results consist of a DisabilityBenefits Questionnaire (DBQ)   and possibly other supporting clinical information .
0  VLER DAS sends the exam result with the EDIPI as the patient identifier to the Health Data Repository (HDR) for storage  when the EDIPI is available .
0  As a consuming application  I want a list of available exam results (first pass) retrieved byPatient ID so that I can request the exam result (second pass) that I need from the list .
0  Interested parties must retrieve stored exam results to review and adjudicate disability claims .
1  VBA will only retrieve those exam results that have an associated claim established .
0  VBA currently uses (in most cases) the Social Security Number (SSN) as the patient identifier associated with a specific claim .
0  Producing applications send patient identifying information to Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) Data Access Services (DAS) with the exam result .
0  VLER DAS obtains the Patient ID and Assigning Authority (based upon the patient identifying information sent by the producing application) and sends this information with the exam result to the Health Data Repository (HDR) for storage .
0  Hence  consuming applications can query VLER DAS for exam results stored with a given Patient ID and Assigning Authority .
0  VLER DAS receives a request from a consuming application for a list of exam results filtered by Patient ID (Electronic Data Interchange Personal Identifier (EDIPI)   ICN  or SSN)   Assigning Authority  and Assigning Facility .
0  VBA uses SSN as the patient identifier when querying by Patient ID  Assigning Authority  and Assigning Facility .
0  VHA uses ICN (when a unique ICN exists) as the patient identifier when querying by Patient ID  Assigning Authority  and Assigning Facility .
0  VLER DAS sends a list of available exam results filtered by Patient ID  Assigning Authority  and Assigning Facility to the consuming application (first pass)  .
0  In the first pass pick-list VLER DAS sends the following common data elements for each available exam result to the consuming application\: Disability Benefit Questionnaire (DBQ) Document Type .
0  In the first pass pick-list VLER DAS sends the following common data elements for each available exam result to the consuming application\: Creation Date (Date  Time  and Time Zone) .
0  In the first pass pick-list VLER DAS sends the following common data elements for each available exam result to the consuming application\: Date Status Modified (Date  Time  and Time Zone) .
0  In the first pass pick-list VLER DAS sends the following common data elements for each available exam result to the consuming application\: Status of Exam Result .
0  In the first pass pick-list VLER DAS sends the following common data elements for each available exam result to the consuming application\: The consuming application sends the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for a specific exam result from the first pass pick-list to VLER DAS .
0  VLER DAS processes the request for a specific exam result .
0  In the first pass pick-list VLER DAS sends the following common data elements for each available exam result to the consuming application\: VLER DAS sends the specific exam result to the consuming application (second pass)  .
0  In the first pass pick-list VLER DAS sends the following common data elements for each available exam result to the consuming application\: VLER DAS sends the specific exam result to the consuming application (second pass) each time the user selects an item from the same pick-list .
0  VLER DAS sends a pick-list of available exam results to the consuming application (first pass) in response to a request for exam results filtered by Patient ID (i .e .  EDIPI  ICN  or SSN)   Assigning Authority  and Assigning Facility .
0  In the first pass pick-list VLER DAS sends the common data element Patient Information (First Name  Middle Name  Last Name  Date of Birth  ID  Assigning Authority  and Assigning Facility) for each available exam result to the consuming application .
0  In the first pass pick-list VLER DAS sends the common data element Document ID for each available exam result to the consuming application .
0  In the first pass pick-list VLER DAS sends the common data element DBQ Document Type for each available exam result to the consuming application .
0  In the first pass pick-list VLER DAS sends the common data element Creation Date (Date  Time  and Time Zone) for each available exam result to the consuming application .
0  In the first pass pick-list VLER DAS sends the common data element VA Facility Information (Name  ID  Assigning Authority) for each available exam result to the consuming application .

0  As a consuming application or user of exam results  I want producing applications (i .e .  Health Data Repository ) to limit the number of list results (first pass) returned to five hundred (500) for Disability Benefits Questionnaire (DBQ) queries  so that VLER DAS can optimize performance  and ensure usability .
0  The DBQ Service is currently required to support 100 000 new DBQ claims per month  with a higher growth factor expected in the future .
0  Consuming applications can query VLER DAS for exam results (i .e .  DBQs and attachments) using various filter criteria configurations .
0  For example  if a Veterans Benefit Administration (VBA) Ratings Specialist submitted a query for exam results with a date range of 6 months and a status of Complete there potentially could be hundreds of thousands of exam results meeting this criteria .
0  Therefore  a maximum results limitation must be included in order to prevent VLER DAS from being overwhelmed .
0  The maximum results value of 500 allows the DBQ Service participants to function within performance requirements  while also providing the consuming applications with adequate information needed to adjudicate disability claims .
0  VLER DAS receives a maximum of 500 results in reverse chronological order by Creation Date (i .e .  the most recent 500 results are returned) in the first pass pick-list from HDR  and sends the pick-list to the consuming application .
0  If the 500 maximum result limit is reached   then VLER DAS receives a message as part of the pick-list stating 500 Max Record Limit Reached from HDR  and sends the message to the consuming application .
0  If the 500 maximum result limit is reached  then VLER DAS receives a message as part of the pick-list stating 500 Max Record Limit Reached from HDR  and sends the message to the consuming application .

0  Examples of how this functionality may be used are\: Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) expects completed exam results for a veteran  however no notification is received .
0  The reviewer knows the date it was last worked and would like to query by Date Status Modified .
0  Health Data Repository (HDR) populates and stores the Date Status Modified when the status has changed  hence the consuming application can query Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) Data Access Services (DAS) by using the element Date Status Modified .
0  VLER DAS receives a request from a consuming application for a list of exam results filtered by date range for Date Status Modified .
0  VLER DAS sends a list of available exam results filtered by date range for Date Status Modified to the consuming application (first pass)  .

0  Conversation\: MVI (Master Veteran Index) will be the only system used by the DAS (Data Access Service) for any identity management function .
0  DAS will interface with MVI in the following environments\: The DAS MVI Component will call MVI to translate a PID (Person Identifier)   from ICN to EDIPI or vice versa  as required by DAS to access producers .
0  DAS will only call MVI for translation when a PID is needed by at least one producer that DAS calls and the type of PID supplied by the consumer differs from the type of PID required by the producer (e .g . consumer supplies an ICN but producer requires an EDIPI or consumer supplies an EDIPI and producer requires an ICN)  .
0  DAS will interface with MVI in the following environments\: DAS will only perform reads on MVI data  not writes such as Adds  Updates  or Deletes .
0  DAS will not establish PID correlations with the MVI .
0  DAS will interface with MVI in the following environments\: DAS will not store a cache of MVI correlations .
0  DAS will interface with MVI in the following environments\: DAS may need to subscribe to ICN maintenance messages from the MVI  if DAS caches documents .
0  Since documents would be cached with the AA (Assigning Authority) and PID  whenever a PID changes  DAS would need to either purge the cache or update the cached documents with the new PID .
0  DAS will interface with MVI in the following environments\: DAS will call MVI to get a list of correlated identities (Source IDs) based on the consumer applications submitted PID .
0  DAS will interface with MVI in the following environments\: If the DAS receives an error from the MVI  the DAS will report an HTTP error back to the consumer application .
0  DAS will interface with MVI in the following environments\: If the MVI returns multiple identities for a requested PID  the DAS will submit requests to the necessary producers using each of the identities returned from the MVI and will aggregate the results as needed .
0  While a Client should only have a single EDIPI and a single ICN  the MVI data model does allow for a Veteran to have multiple identifiers of the same type .
0  DAS will interface with MVI in the following environments\: DAS will use the new interface to MVI which uses the SOAP protocol and HL7v3 .0 data standard over HTTP on the VA network .
0  DAS will only query the MVI for current active source IDs (Deprecated PIDs will not be returned from MVI to DAS)  .
0  The specific scenario to test this is as follows\: A producer (Producer 1) that accepts EDIPI as the PID interfaces with DAS .
0  The specific scenario to test this is as follows\: Other producer(s) (Producers 2) that accept ICN also interface with DAS .
0  The specific scenario to test this is as follows\: A Veteran has BIE possibly and possibly HIE records from the Producer 1 and at least one of the Producers 2 .
0  The specific scenario to test this is as follows\: A consumer application submits a request to DAS using ICN .
0  The specific scenario to test this is as follows\: A producer (Producer 1) that accepts ICN as the PID interfaces with DAS .
0  The specific scenario to test this is as follows\: Other producer(s) (Producers 2) that accept EDIPI also interface with DAS .
0  The specific scenario to test this is as follows\: A consumer application submits a request to DAS using EDIPI .
1  As a consuming application  I want to send a query to the Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record (VLER) Data Access Services (DAS) for Care Coordinator Profile data on a patient identified by ICN (Integration Control Number)   a national VA patient ID  so that VLER DAS can use the MVI (Master Veteran Index) getCorrespondingIDs service to obtain a corresponding EDIPI (Electronic Data Interchange Personal Identifier)   a national DoD service member ID  by which DAS can retrieve the requested data from the appropriate producers and return it to me .
0  VLER DAS sends the ICN for the Veteran or Service Member to the MVI to get the EDIPI required by the producing applications  in response to a request for Care Coordinator Profile information from a consuming application that uses ICN .
0  VLER DAS sends the request with EDIPI to the producing applications to identify the Veteran or Service Member .
0  VLER DAS sends the requested Care Coordinator Profile information to the consuming application .
0  For the existing and currently planned consumers and producers served by VLER DAS  the only case where invocation of the MVI getCorrespondingIds service is needed is when a consumer requests Care Coordinator Profile data from the producer systems  and the patient is identified by ICN .
0  In this case  the MVI is used to obtain the corresponding EDIPI .
0  The Consumer must have network access to VRS over the Internet .
0  VRS must have network access to MVI over the VA Wide Area Network (WAN)  .
0  VRS must have network access to Producers over the VA Wide Area Network (WAN)  .
0  The Consumer makes a First Pass request to VRS for Care Coordinator Profile data .
0  This is done through the following steps\: The Consumer issues a REST request to VRS with a URL specifying Care Coordinator Profile data and with a patient ID that may be either an ICN or EDIPI .
0  This is done through the following steps\: The Consumer receives back an Atom Feed as a First Pass response to the request .
0  The Atom Feed includes URL links to the actual data (Subject Documents) gathered from all available Producers .
0  Each link contains the appropriate patient ID (possibly translated from the first pass request) needed by the producer system identified in the link .
0  The REST request is routed to a business process in VRS that requests Care Coordinator Profile data from all available Producers .
0  The business process in VRS performs the following steps\: Receives a First Pass REST request in the form of a URL from a consumer .
0  The business process in VRS performs the following steps\: Checks whether the patient ID in the request is ICN or EDIPI .
0  The business process in VRS performs the following steps\: Creates a SOAP getCorrespondingIds request to MVI requesting all patient IDs corresponding to the ICN .
0  The business process in VRS performs the following steps\: Sends getCorrespondingIds request to MVI and receives a synchronous response .
0  The SOAP response from MVI contains a list of all patient IDs known by the MVI that correspond to the given ICN .
0  The business process in VRS performs the following steps\: Creates a modified REST request for each producer  substituting the EDIPI  obtained from the MVI response  in place of the ICN .
0  The business process in VRS performs the following steps\: Sends the REST request (updated in step 5 if necessary) to the Producers .
0  The business process in VRS performs the following steps\: Aggregates responses from the Producers into a single Atom Feed .
0  The business process in VRS performs the following steps\: Returns the Atom Feed to the Consumer .
0  Steps 2 through 5 add support for invoking the MVI getCorrespondingIds service to the existing VLER DAS business process for retrieving Care Coordinator Profiles from the Producers .
0  The MVI request and response conform to References 2 and 3 .
0  MVI performs the following\: Receives a SOAP getCorrespondingIds request from VRS containing a patient ID  in this case an ICN .
0  MVI performs the following\: Constructs a SOAP response containing a list of all the IDs by which the patient is known to MVI .
0  This list is expected to contain the EDIPI for the patient .
0  MVI performs the following\: Returns the response to VRS .
0  Each producer performs the following steps\: Receives a First Pass REST request from VRS .
0  Each producer performs the following steps\: Retrieves Care Coordinator Profile data and forms an Atom Feed .
0  Each producer performs the following steps\: Returns the Atom Feed to VRS .
0  The consumer has received a response from VRS to their First Pass request for Care Coordinator Profile data .
0  The PID on the request must specify an ICN or EDIPI .
0  The links on the URLs in the Atom Feed pick list will have EDIPI as needed by the Producers to handle Second Pass requests .
