1  To load value into a slot of the CEP card securely, the load device establishes a connection between the issuer and the CEP card . 
1  The card should use a unique diversified secret key, personalized into the card, to generate and authenticate transaction signatures . 
1  If this is not a cash load, the funds issuer needs to verify that the funds are requested by the legitimate account owner, which is normally done by the presentation of an enciphered PIN . 
1  The card issuer needs to ensure that the load acquirer is guaranteeing payment for the electronic value, and that the card is authentic .

0  Currency exchange rate fluctuations may increase the card issuers liability. The card issuer must be able to adjust maximum balances to bring them in line with their policies. The card issuer may update the maximum balances as part of a load, a partial unload, and a currency exchange transaction. On a currency exchange transaction, only the crypto currency maximum balance may be updated. 
0  A CEP card may contain currencies that the load acquirer does not support. As a result, load devices must use the alphabetic issuer-supplied currency code and currency exponent from the CEP slot(s) to display the source amounts for the currency conversion transaction. 
0  Card issuers must provide an alphabetic currency code in each message that establishes a new currency. This alphabetic currency code and the currency exponent will be used by the load device to display currency balances. This allows the cardholder to identify the currency being displayed.

0  The card issuer must notify the cardholder if the assessment of service fees by the card issuer during the currency exchange transaction may result in a balance of zero after the transaction has completed. 
0  The card issuer must have the ability to deactivate a CEP application in the response to a load or currency exchange transaction. 
0  The CEP card may support multiple currencies. Each currency occupies a lot within the CEP. The slots are defined by the currency supported. The currency for an individual slot is determined during load or currency exchange. Currency exchange could apply to a single slot, and then only for the total balance. 
0  A single currency cannot occupy more than one slot. The CEP card must not permit a slot to be assigned a currency if another slot in the CEP card has already been assigned to that currency.
0  The CEP card limits each slot to a maximum balance. The maximum balance for a slot is established when a currency is assigned to the slot, and is determined externally by the card issuer or by CEP card data which indicates a maximum balance in a reference currency. There is no requirement that all slot maximums have the same relative value, and there is no requirement for the card to maintain a maximum total value. 
1  Only one version of the CA public key is required in the card. This requires that the PSAMs with which the CEP card exchanges cryptograms must be capable of generating and validating cryptograms using the relevant keys from all current cards .

1  The issuer host must authenticate the card upon the load or unload request . 
1  The card must authenticate the issuer host upon the response to the request . 
1  A proof must be sent to the load acquirer that a load or unload occurred to avoid repudiation . 
1  The management of keys must be accomplished in a secure, certified environment . 
1  There may be multiple certification authorities that manage keys for the system, including the possibility of one overall highest level certification authority (perhaps on an international level), and domestic certification authorities for each country or region . 
1  The system must protect the integrity of key transaction data including transaction identification, currency code and amount. If tampering is suspected, the system must cause the transaction to fail . 
0  Expired cards must not be used for loading electronic value.
0  The time period during which a cardholder can unload electronic value, perform a purchase or a currency exchange from an expired card may be determined by each issuer. 
0  Consumers must be able to load electronic value to their cards at any participating load device, regardless of the location, provided that the currency that is requested is supported by the acquirer and the card issuer. 
1  Funds issuers must accept funds authorization requests, regardless of the load currency type, as permitted . 
0  Load devices that are available to the general public should support multiple sources of funding and support both linked and unlinked loads. .
